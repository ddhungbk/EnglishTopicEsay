Topic 1.	Why do people attend college? @People attend college or university for many different reasons (for example, new experiences, career preparation, increased knowledge). Why do you think people attend college or university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: People study in college or university for many different reasons. I think the most important reason is to gain more knowledge and learn more skills. Of course, there are also many other reasons that people study in college such as to get more friends, and increase one's self-confidence.
	These days, most jobs require people who are educated and have good job skills. Therefore, the people who want a good job have to study hard and at least graduate with a high education. Furthermore, as technology advances all over the world, more and more education is required of people.
	Some people who study in college or university want to make more friends and increase their interpersonal skills. They enjoy their lives in university or college and tend to socialize a lot. They can meet more people who have the similar interests with themselves. They can go to uni ball after school and make more friends who they trust.
	The people who graduate from college seem more confident in our community. These people are more respected by society. Many people want to be respected and to be important by family, friends, their bosses, and others in their lives. They find that most of them can confidently talk and do their jobs as they are more educated. Therefore, most people want to get the confidence through the university or college study.
	In today's society, people need more knowledge and skills to be adapted. The university and college study is a good way to achieve this.

Essay 2: In China, more and more people try their best to attend college or university. What are the reasons that make people long for it?
	First of all, in my opinion, the most important reason is to gain competence to live a better life in the future. Competition of our days has become more and more drastic, and even a very simple job or low position will attract hundreds of candidates to apply for it. Only those who have a good education and general knowledge can gain better work. So, we should attend college or university for better competence.
	Second, attending college or university can change our life. For example, to myself, I am a student from countryside. I am one of the few people who can attend college or university. Most of those who have not studied in college or university go to work early in a small factory in a small town or on a farm in their hometown. Just because I have taken higher education, I can get better chances to study or work in the capital of our country where a lot of people want to go to. Why? Good education gives me chances to change my life.
	The third reason for attending a college is to increase knowledge. Study is a so interesting thing that it make our life rich and colorful. It expands our eyesight by informing us with lots of new things what we cannot gain from our common life or experience. On the other hand, by attending college or university, you can learn the knowledge or skill necessary for your future work.
	People attend college or university for various reasons. Some may attend for new experiences, and others may think about other things. What I have mentioned is just very few of them.

Essay 3: Mr.Taoxingzhi, the most famous educator in China, once said: the biggest misfortune in one’s life is that one does not receive a university education. Needless to say, a university degree often helps a person achieve his goal with more ease. However, do we attend university just in pursuit of a degree? Does a university only provide us nothing beneficial besides a paper-made diploma? 
	As far as I am concerned, we enjoy a university education in the following aspects which attributes us to a university education:
	Firstly, with the knowledge learned in a university, we will have a deep understanding with our society. It is true that genuine knowledge comes from practice, but it cannot be denied that genuine knowledge, tells us how to practise. A thorough study in a college or university, of course, enables us to realize how the society works and how to cope with certain problems arising from it in a more efficiently, more skillful way.
	Second, a university education usually make it possible that we acquire a decent job. Because of an accomplishment of a four-year study, it is not difficult for us to find a good job in most cases. 
	How can we imagine that a graduate majoring in astronomy has to be a vendor in the street! Undoubtedly, he/she should sit in his/her laboratory, making a research on aircraft on a computer. Obviously, a university education assures him/her a decent job.
	Last, but not the least, we can help others much better if putting what we learn in a university into use. A university education corrects our values, enhance our skills, and broad our horizons. With those, we are more capable of giving a hand to those who are in need of help than before. 
	“Knowledge is power”. When achieving a degree in a university, we can get a better understanding of the society, find a decent job in an easy way, and help others better. All of those are due to the knowledge learned in a university.
@Notes: 
Essay 4: People attend a college or a university for the following reasons, to acquire knowledge which is necessary for a career, to contribute to the society, and to experience life. 
	Firstly college education is a necessary step for a person who wants to start a career in science and technology areas. If a student wants to become a scientist, it is important for him to go to a science school; if he wants to be an engineer, an engineering school is the best place for him. There is no other place than a college where a student can get sophisticated education in order to be qualified to become a professional in a specific area.
	Secondly, a college education can benefit both the society and the student. By attending college one can get himself prepared for and contribute to the society, which seems to demand advanced knowledge more and more. One the other hand, as knowledge plays a very important role in today’s economy, it has also become the capital and asset of the person who owns it: a college education can bring wealth not only to the society, but also benefit the individual who processes it. 
	In addition, college education is a wonderful experience in one’s life. Only in a college one can be taught by the finest scholars and meet with the most intelligent people in the nation. Education can also bring happiness to the student. When a student has conquered a difficult mathematical problem, he savors the joy which learning has brought to him, and feels that he is the happiest man in the world. 
	Of course, learning in a campus does not mean as much for everybody, but it does mean a lot to me. I was brought up in a knowledge-respecting family. My farther is an engineer and my mother is a teacher in a primary school. They are both university graduates. My father, being the most influential person in my life and the son of a poor Chinese farmer, did change the destiny of his own by learning hard to earn a university degree. Therefore he firmly believes that “knowledge can change one’s destiny and university is the best place to achieve one’s goal”. Of course this influenced me. I strongly believe that attending university is the best choice for me. I do not have a bit of hesitation to attend a university.
@Notes: 
Essay 5: Why do people need to attend colleges or universities? Different people have different answers to this question. I believe that the three most common reasons are to prepare for a career, to have new experiences, and to increase their knowledge of themselves and the world around them. 
	Career preparation is becoming more and more important to young people. For many, this is the primary reason to go to college. They know that the job market is competitive. At college, they can learn new skill for careers with a lot of opportunities. This means careers, such as information technology, that are expected to need a large workforce in the coming years.
	Also, students go to colleges and universities to have new experiences. This often means having the opportunity to meet people different from those in their hometowns. For most students, going to college is the first time they've been away from home by themselves. In addition, this is the first time they've had to make decisions on their own. Making these decisions increases their knowledge of themselves.
	Besides looking for self-knowledge, people also attend a university or college to expand their knowledge in subjects they find interesting. For many, this will be their last chance for a long time to learn about something that doesn't relate to their career.
	I would recommend that people not be so focused on a career. They should go to college to have new experiences and learn about themselves and the world they live in.
@Notes: 
Essay 6: Now days, more and more people are trying to attend college or university. Different people do so for different reasons. Some typical reasons are new experiences, career preparation and increased knowledge. In my opinion, it is the fast development, almost explosion, of our world that make people to consider attending college or university. 
	People would usually get bored when they focus on one field for a long time. For this reason, they go to college to pursue experiences in new areas. We often hear that an electrical engineer went to a university to study art or music. With the new experiences, they expand their ken. Maybe some good ideas would jump out during their daily work. 
	As for the young, they attend college for career preparation. Not only could they get knowledge needed for their future work, they could learn how to think and how to solve questions. The projects students attended are very like their future work. 
	Some people, who have been graduated from universities for years, are also planning to go back to school. Most of them attend universities to increase their knowledge. Technology is developing so fast that people could not keep up with them unless they keep increasing their knowledge. 
	All in all, people, who attend college or university, are preparing for their better futures.
@Notes: 
Essay 7: College is a place that the students can learn more and new knowledge and experience in it. Of course, different people have different reason to study in college. For example, some people want to be to go on a further study after they graduate from the college; some people hope to find a good job after their studying in the college and also some people wish to exchange their present situation through studying in the college. In my opinion, no matter what reason people study in the college for, studying in the college is just a preparation for their future life. 
	First of all, students can learn new knowledge and experiences from the studying in the college. There are many teachers, professors with abundant teaching experience who teach students lots of new knowledge and help them to solve the problems in their study. With their help, student can learn a lot of useful basic and professional knowledge which is very helpful for their future work and study. After they finish their study in the college, students go to work in the society and contribute to the different fields. 
	Secondly, students can learn how to arrange their own time reasonably. Before their studying in college, their life often arranged by their parents and their study often arranged by their teachers. It is very different for them to live and study in college, because students studying in college have to arrange their life and study by themselves. They have right to arrange their part time, such as when to get up, when is the sport-time, when to finish the assignment, etc. This is very important experience for students' work and life in the future. 
	Thirdly, studying in the college make students having opportunity to live with other student and learn how to cooperate with other people. Usually, people often have uncomfortable feeling to live with a stranger, because they do not know each other and perhaps their habit and personality are different. But for the long run, it is good for them. They have to cooperate with each other and solve a lot of problems they will face together. Gradually, they can learn how to care and understand other people. It is a preparation for students to go to cooperate with other people in the society. 
	All in all, students not only can learn lots of new knowledge from the books but also can learn much more necessary experience such as how to arrange time and how to cooperate with other people. It is very important for their future work and life.
@Notes: 
Essay 8: Today more and more people attend college or university. But why? As a student of a key university, I want to give my opinion. 
	Of course, we attend university to increase knowledge. University provides some basic knowledge for our research or our career in the following years. It provides basic information about the major we chose, such as what it research in. If you find that you are not interested in that major, u can change it, till u find one u are interested in. It also provides knowledge for all majors, such as advanced mathematics, English, physics, basic chemistry. Teacher there can help you to decide what you do in the future, to enter a graduate school or to take a job. We must do a lot of experiment during the school years, that makes us quite capable. We visit a factory in the second year to get a general idea about the work our major do. And we have an internship in the third year to do the real work. 
	Then, you can get new experience from university. You can join the student union or join a club. 
	You can learn a lot from it. First, you can learn how to communicate with the different people. And u can learn how to organize a meeting or a party. 
	And also you can prepare for your career. There are lots of programs to let the students be trained for a job. University runs the program by cooperating with some very large company, some manager from the company will give us some courses which teach us how to run a company, how to lead your group to finish the work, how to cope with some problem, and how to be more confident. And they also tell us which kind of employee they want in the company. These things are quite useful for us, especially for those who want to get a job after graduation. 
	Now you know that university is quite useful, but the most important thing it teaches us is not the knowledge nor the experience, it is how to think and how to learn.
@Notes: 
Essay 9: Nowadays, more and more young people attend the universities for different reasons. According to the survey, the main goal of what most of them do so is for career preparation.
	There are many reasons to demonstrate it. The most primary reason is that is that university are the most suitable spot to absorb knowledge, which mostly determines your career development. With the development of the society, "knowledge is power" has been a rule: the more knowledge one possesses, the more easily he succeeds in his career. For instance, it is often reported that MBA graduates in famous universities, such as Harvard, will acquire high start payment when the companies employ them for the first time. After several works, abundant working experience and solid knowledge base will make them further develop in the manager class.
	Another reason is that universities will provide one with not only knowledge but also many other abilities, including communication ability, corporation ability, and independency ability etc., which are beneficial to future career. At the same time, he can make friends with his schoolmates and deals with all kinds of people, who often become his colleagues or business partner in the future. Furthermore, in this way, his view will be widened and abilities will be improved. When he goes off the campus, he always has stronger competition ability than those who do not go to the universities.
	Last but not the least one is that in contrast, history illustrates that people refused by the universities have few opportunities to succeed in their career development. Because of their low educational level, most companies would rather employ them as physical workers than mental workers. In this way, the development of technology and science will fall them into disuse. Such as in many manufacturing factories now, there are automatic machines as substitute for workers. 
	In a word, of many reasons for people to go to universities, career preparation has been the most primary. When education background becomes more important in career development, it will attract more people to do so for a long period.
@Notes: 
Essay 10: There are many people want to go to university or college every year and they decide to do so for many different reasons. I believe there are three common reasons are to prepare for career, increase their knowledge and get new experience. 
	Prepare for career is very important for young people nowadays. In a competitive society, if they have not a good educational background, they will not get a good opportunity in their career or even cannot find a job, so college and university can provide them new skills to meet the requirements of career. 
	Also, students attend to university or college can increase their knowledge in subjects they interested, for many people, this is maybe the primary reason to go to college. There are many excellent professors and experts can give us a plenty of knowledge which including many areas. For many people this maybe their last chance for a long time to get knowledge that don't relate to their career. 
	Besides looking for knowledge, some people want to go to college or university because they decide to live a new life. University can support young people an environment where they can intercommunicate about many topics such as literature, goal of life, art and emotions which are hard to talked about after their university lives, so it is a special experience for young people to live and study in college or university. 
	All in a word, I prefer increase knowledge and get a special experience to prepare for career in university because getting good opportunities in career is partly depend on your knowledge and experiences on diverse areas.

Topic 2.	Are parents the best teachers? @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? “Parents are the best teachers.” Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: Who teaches you to walk? Who teaches you to speak? It is your parents who teach you to do these basic things in your life. So don't you think that parents are the best teachers! 
	Firstly, parents know us very much. Parents give us life, and I think that we will spend large amount of time with them. So they know our merit and demerit in details. Meanwhile, they will help us to get rid of our demerit.
	Furthermore, parents possessed many experiences. Since they are older than us, they have experienced many things. Sometimes, they are just like our models. And as the saying goes: "Example is better than precept."So we will unconsciously copy some of our parents' habits and styles of behavior, i.e. we can learn many things from them.
	Finally, parents will teach us everything. Since schoolteachers can just teach us knowledge from the books, our parents can teach us everything. For example, I learn knitting, cooking and make-up from my mother, while learn fixing leaky faucet from my father. They are the persons who love me most, so they will teach me everything without reservations. 
	Just as the saying goes: "There is no place like home." And I think there is no teacher like our parents. They are the best teachers in our life.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Some people believe parents maybe a very important teacher for children, but will be taken place by teacher after children go to school, however, I believe parents always are the best teacher no matter how many knowledge children have acquired from school, the reasons why I think so go as follow. 
	First, children always imitate their parents from birth, so the parents' influence on children is great. For example, researchers said that parents' expression can influence the growth of their children's character, if parents always smell and watch their child while he is playing, the child's confidence will be greater than other child whose parents always leave him alone at home. 
	Second, parents are also the best teacher for children in emotional area. For example, if a child feel oppression or feel frustrated in school, he always not talk to his teacher, at this time, parents can help him and child are also willing to tell his inner feeling to his parents. 
	Third, although child get many knowledge from teacher, basic skills in his whole life are come from his parents. For example, our basic language skill, basic realize skill and even basic sport skill are all acquired from parents. Because of this basic skill parents teach their child, the influence of parents will follow the child's whole life. 
	All in a word, the effect parents take on the child's education process is greater than any teachers in school, they are the best teacher.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Parents influence greatly their children for a lifetime. I think people are melded by two factors, family and the society that they are in. From birth, humans are influenced by the surrounding people for their characteristics. Parents take a big role in bringing up children, which affects their lives for a long time. 
	In early infanthood, babies are looking to moms and dads to learn basic manners to be accepted in society. Some of these manners include not running around in restaurants or hitting other kids. As they grow up, they learn more from parents about social etiquette, which makes them more suitable to live in society. Children tend to look to their parents for role models knowingly or unknowingly. 
	Besides, parents can also affect children's study habits. Children of doctors, lawyers, investment bankers, and other professionals see their mothers and fathers work a lot of time, reading books, and punching keyboards, even at home. They are showing their children how to study by their own behavior. 
	However, parents can also be a bad example for their kids. It is difficult for children who have abusive parents to lead a normal childhood and is possible that they may become similar to their abusive parents when they grow up. In this sense, the parents' negative role in shaping the children's personality cannot be emphasized more. 
	In conclusion, parents are the best teachers for their children. They leave big marks on their children's lives and are therefore more influential teachers than any others they may have in their lives.
@Notes: 
Essay 4: Who are the best teachers in our life? In my opinion, the first teachers we have in our lives in most cases are our parents. They teach us to walk, to speak, and to have good manners before we reach "the real world." More than even the professional teachers that we have in school, parents are generally the most involved in the development and education of children. 
	The main reason for my view is that our parents are the best teachers at the beginning of our lives, which actually corresponds to the parents' role in nature. Parents are most committed and involved in teaching their children; they have a kind of instinct to sacrifice a part of themselves for the betterment of their children. They love us and have great patience while passing down their knowledge to us. They wish us a success and thus will not teach us bad things. And of course, implicit learning occurs when children unconsciously copy some of their parents' habits and styles of behavior. 
	Also, during the second stage of child development, adolescence, parents can still be in the best position to offer advice even though the children might not accept it. In this case, perhaps the child's friends would be the best teachers. Adolescents are notoriously rebellious in many cultures and may automatically reject any advice from their parents. My first marriage for instance, was solely a matter of doing the opposite when my parents tried to intrude in offering their advice. So in such matters, parents should be much more flexible and be rather the partners with their children. So we can see that being a teacher of growing child become more and more complicated case as the time passes and many parents are simply not able to meet the increased demands. 
	On the other hand, I would say that parents are not professional teachers and they tend to be very biased by their love of their children. So wishing good things and an easy life may prevent children from maturation. In any case, parents usually can present only one viewpoint of the world, while good teaching should be based on different attitudes. Thus, when children go to school and have a great diversity of teachers, they learn much more than their parents could probably give them. Furthermore, once our parents get older, they become more conservative and cannot always be objective in regard to modern trends and fashions. Thus we need to take their advice with caution during that period. However, some kind of intuition which I believe shared between relatives about what everybody needs and great love which exists in a families still makes our parents are very good teachers and advisers at any time. 
	In short, while parents are not the ideal teachers, and well-rounded children will generally need a great diversity of teachers in their lives in order to have a more accurate view of the world, parents are generally the most committed of all teachers and have the greatest emotional investment in their children and their future.

Topic 3.	Has food improved people's live? @Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: Man, through the ages, has undergone many changes, from a period when he hunted for his food to the present era when man is dependent on preprocessed foods. During this period not only has man changed his mode of eating but his whole lifestyle as well. In pursuit of more in this competitive world, man no longer has time as he once had. He is caught in a race against the clock. A person who finishes more in lesser time is considered more efficient. This pressure to do more in less time has affected his eating habits as well and, as a result, man no longer has time to cook food. Early man's only objective was to seek food to sustain him and his family. Nowadays finding food has taken a back seat to other priorities, such as career and education. 
	Food is no longer of that importance. This is not an encouraging trend. People are too dependent on preprocessed or precooked food, which no longer has the freshness it once had. Such foods lose their mineral and vitamin content and are not as healthy as fresh food. That is why the number of diseases is also rising. People have also shifted to high calorie content food like French fries, pizzas, and ice cream, etc., which is causing obesity, fatigue, etc. As man is becoming busy and too involved in his busy schedule, he has no time even to take care of his own personal needs. 
	Furthermore, cooking is an art which is dying out. People once enjoyed cooking. It was a means of eliminating stress and tension. People were once able to relax during this time and reflect on their lives. 
	People may tend to argue that by using precooked and preprocessed food they are efficiently using time and can use this precious time saved for other purposes. But is it really worth it? This is a question whose answer can invite much speculation about whether by saving this little time we are inviting lots of other problems, which could easily be avoided. It is actually making our lives not simpler but more complicated. We have lost many of the simpler things in our lives, like the simple acts of selecting our evening meal, preparing it, and enjoying it with our loved ones, and we are worse off for it.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Nowadays, wherever we turn our gaze, we can see different types of food that are easier to prepare. For instance, we can buy frozen foods in a supermarket and just prepare it in a couple of minutes, whereas before it could have taken us maybe hours to prepare this kind of meals. I would accept that this so-called improvement has changed our lives, but I believe that there are some drawbacks as well. 
	It is true that these kinds of food do not involve hard work to prepare, but food that is easy to prepare generally has some artificial ingredients mixed in it that makes it "easy-to-cook". If we take time to read the ingredients, we would definitely come across words like preservatives or artificial flavorings. It was just a couple of days ago that I came across a newspaper article which stated that someone was poisoned because he ate this type of food. He was hospitalized for almost a month. 
	Not having to cook has also taken the fun out of cooking. Cooking is an art, but in today's world, this is no truer. People are so busy with their work that they just rely on this simple foods. The invention and production of this foods have made people lazy not only for cooking but also for a well family get-together. It was not like former times when families would sit together and eat freshly baked food. Instead, they are getting these artificial things with minimal nutrients in them. 
	Cooking in the yesteryears was much better than today's. People would spend more time in the kitchen, preparing the food in the way that they liked it. This brought families closer together and also contributed to the high quality and nutrition of the food. Granted, people are busier nowadays and do not have as much time as they did in the past, but I believe that people have forgotten the importance of healthy, fresh food and of the time a family spends together preparing the food. So, I would say that having food that is easy to prepare has had many disadvantages.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: It cannot be doubted that our eating style has encountered a revolutionary change in the last few decades. It is the change in the type of food that has had the greatest influence. Not only have the recipes of certain food types have been altered, but also absolutely new ones have been created. Examples include yet are not restricted to beef hamburgers, potato chips, and cola drinks. All of these changes contribute to making food preparation as fast and easy as possible. It cannot be neglected that modern cooking facilities play a dramatic role in this trend. 
	Some people regard this trend as a spoiler of our lives. Their argument focuses on two main points. First, many newly emerged types of food have not the essence of a "complete meal" as defined by nutritionists. To add to the problem, these food types are often served alone. In fact, there are many medical reports warning people from depending upon such fast meals in their food. Other reports indicate a high potential of malnutrition among those who are "addicted" to the common duet of burgers and cola. 
	Second, the advantage of gathering family members around a meal at home is lost. Fast prepared food types are usually eaten outside home. With the absence of regular family meetings, relationships are likely to be weaker. 
	Others think that fast prepared food types do improve our style of life. This opinion comes especially from busy people, working wives, and younger people. They believe that we have many things in life more important than eating. Time spent on food preparation is considered wasted by them. Wives will have more time to take care of their families' souls not just stomachs. Family relationships will get stronger. Business men and women will have more time to concentrate on their business without worrying about food arrangements. In general, people will have a greater opportunity to take care of their minds and hearts. Reports estimate the time spent on food arrangements as a large percentage of our lives. 
	I agree with that food preparation should take its necessary time and care. Otherwise, the time saved in food preparation can lead to longer times of headache or even of staying in hospitals suffering from malnutrition.
@Notes: 
Essay 4: The twentieth century has brought with it many advances. With those advances, human lives have changed dramatically. In some ways life is worse, but mostly it is better. Changes in food preparation methods, for example, have improved our lives greatly. 
	The convenience of preparing food today is amazing. Even stoves have gotten too slow for us. Microwave cooking is much easier. We can press a few buttons and a meal is completely cooked in just a short time. People used to spend hours preparing an oven-cooked meal, and now they can use that time for other, better things. Plus, there are all kinds of portable, pre-packaged foods we can buy. Heat them in the office microwave, and lunch at work is quick and easy. 
	Food preparation today allows for more variety. With refrigerators and freezers; we can preserve a lot of different foods in our homes. Since technology makes cooking so much faster, people are willing to make several dishes for even a small meal. Parents are more likely to let children be picky, now that they can easily heat them up some pre-packaged macaroni and cheese on the side. Needless to say, adults living in the same house may have very different eating habits as well. If they don't want to cook a lot of different dishes, it's common now to eat out at restaurants several times a week. 
	Healthful eating is also easier than ever now. When people cook, they can use new fat substitutes and cooking sprays to cut fat and calories. This reduces the risk of heart disease and high cholesterol. Additionally, we can buy fruits and vegetables fresh, frozen or canned. They're easy to prepare, so many of us eat more of those nutritious items daily. A hundred years ago, you couldn't imagine the process of taking some frozen fruit and ice from the freezer, adding some low-fat yogurt from a plastic cup and some juice from a can in the refrigerator, and whipping up a low-fat smoothie in the blender! 
	Our lifestyle is fast, but people still like good food. What .new food preparation technology has given us is more choices. Today, we can prepare food that is more convenient, healthier, and of greater variety than ever before in history.
@Notes: 
Topic 4.	Knowledge from experience and books @It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
Essay 1: There are two main channels for people to learn knowledge –from books and from experience. Generally, knowledge gained from books is theoretical, that gained from experience is practical. It is difficult to answer which is more important to we people. It depends on the phases and events of our learning. Knowledge learned from books is instructive, which perhaps cannot learn directly from experience. We often hear thunders and see lightning in the sky, and we can easily find that lightning will be seen sooner than sound will be heard. According to our experience alone, we cannot tell why it had happened. But when we learn some physics in textbooks, we will find the answer clearly that because light travels faster than sound does, it takes less time for light to travel the same distance than for sound. Therefore, book knowledge can inform us some useful theories that can give us general ideas and help us understand the real phenomenon better. 
	In turn, practice knowledge check out the theories gained from books. There is an old Chinese saying that practice is the only criterion of inspecting the truth. So not all knowledge from books is credible, even false. When Aristotle wrote in his transcripts that the earth is the center of our planets, no one doubts this for centuries. However, when Galileo read about it, he did not suspect it at first, but when he made some observation and research, he found it is not the truth. Then comes the new theory - Sun center theory. 
	In our daily life, we can learn much information from practice. To learn swimming, it is useless to be absorbed in reading skills written in books. Only when you learn it in a swimming pool, can you make it. There are still a lot of things you must learn from your own experience, such as driving a car, riding a bicycle, operating a machine. And the most important is that it is often easier learn knowledge from practice than from books. As far as the average people are concerned, it is natural to learn from experience. Primitive people learned skills hand by hand which is the way they were handed down from one generation to another. 
	Modern people also learn things in practice. In workshops, leading workers teach apprentices carefully; in activity clubs, teachers teach youngsters to be familiar with their hobbies. It is obvious that all of things considered knowledge gained from practice is more close and direct than from the books. 
	Therefore, two kinds of knowledge has importance. For research people, knowledge from books is more important, while for our average people, knowledge from practice is more important. As students, we must first learn knowledge from books well, and at the same time we must have the good sense to tell from what is right and what is wrong.

Essay 2: We gain our knowledge about the world and our life from two sources: from experience and from books. These two resources are both important, but which of them is more important?
	Knowledge from books forms a very important part of our knowledge structure. In schools and colleges, we learn knowledge which is fundamental to our future career. We learn knowledge from books in order to make our contributions to this society in the future. A student learns mathematic equations and other scientific knowledge and become a scientist or engineer. We will be illiterate and ignorant without learning knowledge from books. Moreover, we acquire knowledge about life and the world by reading books, magazines and newspapers. This is also very important as we cannot experience everything all by ourselves. Therefore books are a very important source of knowledge. 
	On the other hand, we can't learn everything from a book. “Experience is the best teacher” is an old cliché, but I agree with it. The most important, and sometimes the hardest, lessons we learn in life come from our participation in situations. We learn how to get along with others or how to have self-respect from our experience, not from books. We cannot learn emotional feelings, such as love and care, through books; they come from our real life experience. Knowledge from experience is also a very important supplement to knowledge from books. 
	Needless to say both learning sources, books and experience, are very important to us. But in my opinion knowledge from experience is more important, because without knowledge from experience, it is impossible to get a real understanding of knowledge from books, and how to apply this knowledge to real world situations.

Topic 5.	The influence of factories @A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.
Essay 1: I have been living in a peace and quiet town for about 10 years. All people around here is so kind, and the landscape is so beautiful that I love this town very much. Recently I heard news that a company will set up a new factory near my community. I was shocked and I hold a negative opinion about this decision. 
	The main reason why I oppose this plan is that establishing a new factory will cause air pollution. As we know, a factory will give off a lot of waste air which is harmful to people's health. Even though the factory will take measurements to purify the air, it cannot make the air as clean as before. It is no doubt that people's health will be affected by the air emitted from the factory. Another reason is that a factory makes too much noise. My community is always a quiet place and this is just what I like the most. A factory will cause the town to become too noisy. For example, every morning, we can be awake from our dreams by the noise of buses which take workers to the factory. The noise of engines will also influent our temper, and may cause us susceptible to anger, and easily lose temper. 
	Furthermore, a strong reason to oppose this idea is that building a factory will destroy the landscape of this town. Most people living in this town make their living by cultivating and harvesting crops. The factory is inappropriate with the landscape of the town and it will occupy the land that is used to farming. 
	Of course, building a factory also has advantages to some extent. For example, it will bring more working opportunity for local people, and also it will help developing the local economics. But comparing with the disadvantages, I strongly oppose the idea to build a factory near my community.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: I support the idea that a factory to be built near our community. I list my reasons as follows. Firstly, a new factory near our community helps to improve living standard of people in our community. The factory will employ a lot of workers. As a consequence, the unemployment rate will drop significantly. Many people in our community will find a job in the factory. As people's income increases, they will be able to spend more money on their food, clothing and leisure time, and the quality of life will be increased. 
	Secondly, a new factory will bring prosperity to our community. The tax collected from a factory is an important source of revenue for our town. As people have higher income, income tax collected will also be increased. The town will be able to spend more money on infrastructures and other development. Moreover, in order to accommodate more workers, more homes and stores will be needed. This will boost real estate development in our community. 
	Some people say that a factory would bring smog and pollution, and destroy the quality of the air and water in town. This is not the truth. Modern technologies have made today's factories technology intensive and brought pollutions to the minimum. There are also worries that the social structure of this community will be changed and the traditional life will be affected. We should understand that society needs to evolve and we cannot always stay in the old time. 
	Of course, there will be some drawbacks of building a new factory here. But in my opinion, the benefits outweigh the dangers. I strongly support to build a factory here, and hope that others feel the same way.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: If a large factory is going to be built near your community, is it good or bad? It’s a quite difficult question to answer. Because there are many aspects to take into your consideration, the advantages and the disadvantages. Let’s talk about that. 
	First, a large factory, especially a large chemical factory is quite harmful to our environment when it is built near our community. It will affect our daily life a lot. All the chemical factories will produce a lot of waste and most of the wastes are harmful to the environment, including poisonous gas and liquid. Some of them cannot be entirely broken down. If they are released into the air or the river, it will affect our health. And also the factory may produce a lot of noise. The environment we want to live in is a quiet and peaceful one, so the noise will be quite boring. And yes, noise also affects our health. 
	Still one thing, a factory can be very dangerous. Because a fire or an explosion may break out in the factory. If it’s very near our home, it’s quite dangerous. 
	But in other hand, a factory may be a good news to us. It can provide more jobs for us, especially for the young people in our community. Since the factory is near, it’s so convenient to go to work and the factory will get more chances to our area. It will help to develop our area. So if the factory can bring us a lot of chances, we will agree to build one. But the most important things are: 
	1.	Build the factory in a safe distance from our community, not too near. 
	2.	Make sure that the factory can deal with the waste properly. Do not release the poisonous gas into the air, and not release the waste water into the river nearby. 
	3.	Make sure the security guard in the factory works very well.
@Notes: 
Essay 4: A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near our community. To be frank, I have mixed emotions about this. 
	Obviously, there are some advantages having such a factory nearby. For example, it can provides more job opportunities and many people may work in the factory. What is more, it also gives a good chance for the development of other business in our community such as shops, theatres and restaurants. Furthermore, the products the factory manufactures will improve our quality of living. 
	On the other hand, there are some disadvantages building a factory here. First, it will disturb the quiescence of our community. Once the factory is set up, a lot of people will rush into our community to work, and the road will get crowded. To transfer the raw materials the factory needs, there will be many trucks coming and going through the streets, and the noise will disturb residents and it is unsafe for our children who always play freely in the streets before. 
	Second, the factory will produce many waste products each day, and there will be much waste water coming out from the factory and it will pollute our rivers. We do not want to have to see hundreds and thousands tons of waste piled near our houses, and we do not want to see our nearby rivers turning into black dishes either. 
	After weighing the advantages and disadvantages, I decide to oppose to set up such a factory near our community because we need quiet surrounding, blue sky and clean rivers.
@Notes: 
Essay 5: Weather it is beneficial to build a large factory near our community is a prevalent topic undergoing serious debate. Two different opinions obviously exist to support and to oppose. After pondering the opinions from several aspects, personally, I agree with the idea that it is beneficial to build a large factory near our community. 
	By comparing the advantage and disadvantage they will get, people judge which role they should hold. In my opinion, the advantage in this case is superior than the disadvantage. We can see it below. 
	The main reason for my propensity for the choice is that the factory will supply lots of employment opportunities for society, especially the people of the community nearby. The unemployment will decrease and the people’s standard of living will increase in some degree. So, no doubt, people will accept the factory willingly and rapidly. 
	Another reason why I prefer to the statement lies in the fact that with the developing of the factory, many other establishments will be founded around it. These establishments will make the lives of the people of the community more convenient. For example, drugstores, restaurants, even hospital, new bus stop will be built up. People here will enjoy the convenience the factory brings. 
	It is undeniable that the factory will bring some problems, such as the noise, air pollution. Whatever, these disadvantage will be limited into a low level so that they cannot contaminate the environment of the community. 
	From what has been discussed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that it is beneficial to build a large factory near our community.

Topic 6.	Change one thing about your hometown @If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: Everything in the universe is in constant change. And everything needs continual improvement if the ever changing and increasing demands of humankind are to be met. If I am ever given the chance to change one important thing about my home town, it would be internet service. Needless to say that nothing generally revolutionized the way we live as internet in the past decade. Thus, an improvement in this vital service would mean an even more, unheard betterment to the people in my home town. 
	It is said that information is power. True saying indeed! I can envision how everything in my home town could improve dramatically if the internet service in it were made free, fast and staying out there like electricity, telephone or water all the time. One thing, a fast free and reliable internet service could improve in my home town is the way people work. If there are these services, people in my hometown must not necessarily commute to a far place to do their job. This in turn would mean less traffic jams, spacious work place, more time for family and recreation and so on. 
	The way people learn would be another important thing that a fast, free and reliable internet service could better in my home town. People will have the chance to go through tremendous and different information resources in a very small amount of time. They, apparently will also take less time to share it. This assures a more fulfilled life for my home town people. 
	Since its advent, internet touched every part of our life. It in a dazzling way improved the way we do business, learn and communicate. A change in internet service implies good way of living for every one in my home town.

Essay 2: If I could change one important thing about my hometown, it would be air pollution problem, and I will give the following reasons to explain why I want to solve the problem. 
	The first and most important reason is that I hope that my hometown can become a beautiful city. As an old industrial city, my hometown has made a great deal of contribution for the country’s economic development. At a result, the natural environment of the city has been badly damaged. The forest has disappeared; the mountains have become bald, and the most awful thing is that the air quality becomes more and more worse. People seldom see the blue sky during most time of year. 
	Another reason why I want to change my hometown’s air pollution situation is that the city’s development needs clean and tidy environment to attract investors. Nowadays people have come to know that the city’s environment, which is so called “software facility of the city”, plays an important role in the city’s future. For example, due to the fact that the environment of the city is very poor, many local students who pursue their study out of the city would rather find themselves a job in other cities than coming back to their hometown after they graduated. 
	In addition, nowadays people have paid more and more attention to their health. If air pollution problem cannot be solved as quickly as possible, people’s requirement for a healthy body will never be realized. 
	In my mind, changing air pollution will apparently be my first choice if I can change one important thing about my hometown. Fortunately people in my hometown are gradually aware of the serious problem.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: If I could change one thing about my hometown, I would like to build up some useful and advanced facilities for their use. A modern library, an advanced broad band system and an integrated gym may bring a lot of changes to people living in my hometown and keep them up with the latest information and technology. 
	In my opinion, a modern library in my hometown can provide a good environment for the local people to study and upgrade themselves. There are a lot of newspaper, magazines and reference books for their use. They can know what happened around the world and keep up with the fast pace of this developing world. From lots of cultural books, they also can own a good habit of reading and learn to get knowledge from books. "Knowledge is strength". Knowledge can give us guidance to overcome problems we meet in the daily life. 
	To popularize the broad band at home also is a quick access to Internet and movie channel, which can give people much more chances to choose their entertainment. Because of the Internet, our lives have been changed a lot no matter whether we accept or not. We can read news, buy items from e-commerce companies, send a free e-card to our friends, mail our beautiful photos to anyone we like or watch the movies online. Anyway, Internet brings us obvious changes. Additionally, broad band also can provide movie channel to users. Can you imagine that you can watch the movies you like just by clicking one button? It provide different types of movie for you to choose. People have more choice to enjoy the life and advanced technology at home. 
	Besides important information we need to know and advanced technology we use, we also need to do exercise to keep our healthy life. This is the reason why I want to set up an integrated gym in my hometown. Through doing many various exercises, such as, swimming, jogging, playing badminton or ten nice, people can enhance their ability to resist the virus and enjoy the life happily. Furthermore, people who often do exercise have positive attitudes towards life although when facing difficulties. This is really what I hope to see. 
	In summary, I want my hometown to be a city equipped with a modern library, an advanced broad band system and filled with people liking exercise, loving life and possessing positive attitudes towards life. Thus, I want to build up above-mentioned facilities first.

Essay 4: With the development of my hometown in the past few years, the population is expanding very fast. The city is experiencing not only a higher birth rate than ever, but also waves of immigration. The streets in the city are crowed or even jammed during the rush hours. If I could change one thing about my hometown, I would develop an advanced public traffic system. 
	In order to hold such an exploding population, the city has extended miles by miles without much plan. It is common for people to travel from the southernmost part to the northernmost part of the city to go to work everyday. They have to spend three hours or more on the way they go to work and come home. Eight hours' work is a heavy burden, while people have to spend hours before and after the work. A subway running through or around the city can solve the problem. People could live further away from the downtown without worrying about spending too much time on the way. 
	Some people buy their own car or take a taxi to work everyday. It's really expensive for most of the people in the city. They can't afford paying so much on traffic fares. Many civil engineering experts advocate that sharing a public traffic system is the most efficient way. People could reduce their fares a lot by using the public traffic system, and they can spend the money on some other things. 
	Even there are more and more people who can afford buying a car or taking taxi everyday, it is still suggested to using the public traffic system. Because the road development can never keep up with the demand of the increasing cars, the cars may jam on the roads during rush hours. Usually, the speed of the car in that time is no higher than a bicycle! And pollution is another concern. So many private cars running in the city will bring us an environmental problem. On the other hand, the pollution from the public traffic system is much lighter. 
	All in all, an advanced public traffic system time efficient, cost efficient, and pollution preventing. This is the trend of advanced cities.
@Notes: 
Essay 5: I am from Arroz e Feijao, a small town in the northeast of Brazil. Building a factory in there will bring a lot of advantages and disadvantages, but I believe that Arroz e Feijao will mostly benefit from the building of a new factory because it is largely populated by poor people and the factory would bring many benefits to this small town. However, of course, a factory has disadvantages as well. 
	As you know, factories usually bring pollution. If this factory is not managed very effectively and efficiently according to specific rules, it's prone to polluting the local air and water. What's more, factories usually make noise. Beside clean drinkable water and fresh air, an ideal community should be quiet. If the factory cannot maintain this situation to the community, it will not last long. A factory that is too noisy or pollutes too much will eventually be relocated to a new area. 
	On the other hand, a factory could bring a lot of benefits to the community. So I would support the plan to build a factory to my community for all the reasons I will describe below. 
	First of all, the factory's construction will surely improve the local infrastructure. To run smoothly, the factory will have to have a steady, reliable supply of water and electricity. Some old pipes will be changed, and some facilities will be renovated. The residents' living standard get improved as a result of these widespread changes, an important benefit in Arroz e Feijao, where many people do not have access to clean water. 
	Secondly, to make the employee commute more convenient, the local roads will have to be rebuilt and broadened, resulting in improved public transportation. The town's residents can take a public bus to go shopping or go to work. As a result, air pollution and fuel consumption might be reduced. 
	Most important, a factory's establishment will bring up a lot of employment opportunities for the community. A factory need experts from various fields. The residents can take just a few minutes to go to the factory to work. So, the local residents can get great benefits from this factory. 
	Generally speaking, I agree with the plan to build a factory near my community. If the factory can be managed successfully, the factory and local residents can have mutual benefit.

Essay 6: Have you been waiting for buses at bus station for an hour in an extremely hot day? Have you been staying in a car waiting hours for the heavy traffic? Have you seen the scene that tons of people are crammed on a small bus? Maybe you think that’s incredible, but it’s true in my hometown. So the thing I want to change most about my hometown is the mass transportation system. 
	Mass transportation system is a very important part of a city. It influences people’s daily life, work and entertainment. An effective mass transportation system can save people’s time so that people can do more work hence to increase the city’s efficiency. If you were the mayor, would you like the people in the city to sit in the cars or stand at bus stations wait for hours or would you like them to sit in the offices or stand in factories work for hours? 
	Moreover, a city with bad mass transportation system can’t be qualified as a good city, regardless how rich the city is and how big the city is. It’s essential for a city to have a good mass transportation system to be qualified a good city. For example, big cities such as Toronto, Tokyo, New York all have very good mass transportation systems which can bring people anywhere they want in a short time. A bad mass transportation system would limit the city to grow and it would be a handicap for the city to develop in the future. 
	Finally, as we can see, if my hometown can improve the mass transportation system, people will appreciate it a lot. It will be a great thing which benefits everyone in the city and makes our life more convenient.

Topic 7.	TV and people's behavior @How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: Do movies and television affect our behavior? I believe that movies and television do influence our behavior, both for the better and for the worse. 
	Movies and television influence our behavior because they make us less active. Looking at films is a passive activity. If we watch too much, we become unhealthy, both mentally and physically. We stop using our own imagination when we see things acted out for us. Mental laziness becomes physical laziness; we'd rather watch sports on TV than play sports ourselves. We'd rather visit with the characters on "Seinfeld" or "Friends" than go chat with our own neighbors. Imaginary people have exciting lives. Is it any wonder that some people would rather live a fantasy life than their own? Movies and television also can make people more violent. The more we see violent acts on television, the less sensitive we become to them: Eventually violence doesn't seem wrong. We may even commit violent acts ourselves. This is especially true because we don't always realize that violence has consequences. Actors can be killed and come back for another movie. Sometimes we confuse that with reality. We forget that killing someone is permanent. 
	Of course, watching movies and television can also be good for us. It can give us a broader window on the world. For example, seeing movies can expose us to people of different races and cultures. We can then overcome some prejudices more easily. Recently there have been more handicapped people in films, and this also helps reduce prejudice. 
	The best influence on our behavior is that movies and television reduce stress. Watching films, we can escape our own problems for a little while. Also, sometime movies show positive ways to resolve problems we all face. While TV and movies shouldn't be a way to hide from life, sometimes they can help us cope. 
	It is true that movies and television can influence our behavior negatively. However, I also believe that they influence our behaviour in positive ways. How they affect you depends on how much you watch, what you watch, and how you respond to what you watch.

Essay 2: Hesitating I enter my house, the light outside is dimming and the shadows make everything appear unfamiliar. I know that my husband has not returned from work yet, simply because his car is not in the garage. I am alone. I carefully check all the rooms, almost expecting something to happen suddenly. I hold my bag in my hand as if it were a weapon. After the whole house has been declared "clear," I start to breathe normally again and a smile appears on my face as I realize, once again, how a simple movie seen at the cinema a week earlier can modify my actions. 
	Sometimes I wonder if I should watch TV, with all its shows that make me wonder whether I exercise enough, whether I am slim enough, or whether I treat my pets with the care they deserve: am I really concerned about their mental health? Not to mention the hundreds of commercials that try to make me believe I need a water purifier to remain alive since the water I am currently drinking is heavily polluted! And countless are the times when I have heard people talking by quotations learned from movies. We need to watch shows and films to know what to say, how to be, how to act. We are so addicted to all this that it almost seems like we cannot think on our own. 
	I cannot help thinking about what happened to me some days ago, an example that clearly shows what kind of power TV has over people. My husband and I were in a restaurant when I heard my young neighbour pronouncing violent words in a low angry voice. Surprised, I turned to better understand the situation and I saw that he was holding a fake military device and was acting as if he were filming a war movie. I am sure that if I had been a little be more updated about this type of movie, I would have recognized what he was saying as a quotation. Now, I wonder if he uses such a language also with his friends and with his parents, if he is aggressive, and if so, whether his attitude has really nothing to do with what he watches on TV. 
	That same evening on the way home I saw two cars stopped one next to the other at a traffic light and as soon as the light turned green they started racing, in the middle of town. In this case not even a major knowledge of movies and TV programs would have helped me: there are just too many of them on the market showing the exact same thing: people racing with cars. 
	I am sure that everybody, if asked, could easily list many other examples of how TV and movies can modify our behaviour and therefore our life but, I wonder, if we will always be able to draw the line between a TV show and real life, between what they make us think we want and what instead we really need and are and believe.
@Notes: 
Topic 8.	Has TV destroyed communication? @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.
Essay 1: Television is undoubtedly one of the most powerful means of communication in the history of humankind, rivalled only by such other forms of communication as the Internet, the telephone, movies, and, of course, simple, low-tech speech. Television, with its wide availability and rich media with image and sound, is difficult to ignore and even seductive in its appeal. Television is as much a part of our lives as are our meals, work, or school; studies consistently show that the average American child spends almost as much time watching television as she does in school. Furthermore, because television is so rich in its media, it often requires our full attention or is more attraction to us than are our daily lives. Naturally, the more time one spends watching television, the less time she has with her family and friends. Thus, we can clearly see why some have claimed that television has been harmful for communication among family and friends. However, I believe that, while television has been somewhat harmful in its effects, it has hardly "destroyed" communication among family and friends for most people, although for some, this may be true. 
	Most people much prefer spending time with their families and friends to spending time watching television. Television is of course an important part of many people's lives, but most people would gladly choose family and friends over television were they given the choice. Furthermore, most educated people are aware of the deleterious effects of too much television and either avoid excessive time watching television, or actually do not enjoy it. I, for example, after a long day at work, would much rather spend time talking with my wife and playing with my children than I would watching some unrealistic portrayal of life on television. For me and my family, our time together is precious and beautiful, and could never be replaced or hurt by television. 
	Furthermore, the effect of television is simply not so great that it could be said to have "destroyed" communication among family and friends. Granting that communication among family and friends in industrialized countries has decreased in recent years, it might be tempting to blame this problem on television since its rise roughly coincided with the decrease in time we spend with our families. However, I believe this situation is more likely due to increased pressures relating from work, school, and the economy. In my case, for example, I find that my pressures from work are so great that I must often sacrifice time at home so that I can meet the challenges of running my own business. Many of my friends are in similar situations - my best friend, for example, has just finished law school, which took about sixty hours a week of his time. In a word, people nowadays have very little time for anything, but television is not the cause - it is increased desire to succeed. 
	In some situations, however, television has surely contributed to a decrease in communication among family members. In my childhood in the countryside, I often saw parents and children watching television for hours on end, rarely speaking with one another. It seemed for them that television was a way to escape from their sad, miserable existence. However, even in this case, I would say that television merely contributed to the bad situation, but did not cause it; were television not existent, surely these people would have found other escapes, alcohol or gambling, for example. In other words, people always find a way to do what they want to do. 
	In short, I do not believe that television has destroyed or even harmed interpersonal communication among most people. Most people realize that television is merely a temporary diversion and do not use it to replace interpersonal communication. I believe that the damage attributed to television is greatly exaggerated and that such damage is most likely attributable to other more powerful social factors.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: When asked about what has been brought by television, different people have different answers. There is some people who don't like TV saying that television has destroyed communications among friends and family. However other people take a negative attitude on this issue. In my opinion, I disagree with the above statement. The reasons are given below. 
	Television is only one instrument for people to relax. There is many ways of amusement for people to select after the working time nowadays. You can select to meet your friends, to accompany your parents or to take part in some sports activities. Watching TV at home is simply one way to live. It is too narrowly to regard TV as one main reason to damage relationship among friends and family just because some people has spent a lot of time on it. 
	Another reason that I disagree with the above statement is that TV can provide some additional topics for communication among friends and family. Talking about the news, the soap drama or soccer game watching on the TV last night is also good communication ways to increase your affections with your friends and your family. Also sometimes, skipping one TV program could probably make you lose voices among your friends. 
	Last but not least, watching TV is one good medicine to cure the loneliness when your friends and parents cannot accompany with you. I would not forget the warm which was brought by TV when along outside the hometown. 
	I can't deny that some people has ignored friends and family when they are addicted into watching TV. However, everything has its two sides. All the factors mentioned above determined me to draw the conclusion that it is not reasonable to say television has destroyed communications among friends and family.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Some people believe that television has destroyed communication among friends and family. I think this is an exaggeration. In my opinion, whether or not television hurts communication depends on what type of program is being viewed. More importantly, it depends on the type of viewer. 
	There are empty programs and educational programs. Empty programs do not challenge people. They have just enough storyline to keep them from switching channels. There are also passive and active viewers. A passive viewer will just watch television without thinking about what he or she is seeing. The combination of an empty program and a passive viewer makes communication unlikely. Passive viewers just continue to watch, actually enjoying the fact that they don't have to think. They won't break away to talk about programming with friends and family. Even with better programming, passive viewers still won't think or communicate much. They'll probably even prefer the empty programs because the better programming is too much work. 
	On the other hand, active viewers watching educational programming always want to share what they see with friends and family. "Educational" doesn't necessarily mean documentaries on PBS. They could be dramas with realistic relationships or action shows with clever plotlines. When active viewers watch programs, they have ideas and talk about them with others. Good programming inspires them to change their thinking and their lives. Unlike passive viewers, they don't want to watch more and more without thinking. 
	In short, television may destroy communication among passive viewers. Those viewers probably don't want to communicate with friends and family much anyway. For active viewers who already enjoy communicating, television is actually helpful!

Topic 9.	Which place to live in? @Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.
Essay 1: I grew up in a small town and then moved to a big city, so I have experienced the good and bad sides of both. I never thought that I would like living in a big city, but I was wrong. After ten years of living in one, I can't imagine ever living in a small town again. 
	Small towns and big cities both have some problems in terms of transportation. In a small town, you have to own a car to ensure a comfortable living. You can't get around without one because there isn't any kind of public transportation. Big cities generally have heavy traffic and expensive parking, but there you have a choice of taking public transportation. It's not free, but it's often cheaper than driving when you consider gas and time. Especially if you don't have a car, you're better off in the city. 
	I love the excitement of big cities. Small towns have a slow pace. Large cities mean you have to adapt to a variety of situations, like finding a new route to work or trying a new restaurant. I enjoy that challenge very much. Another pan of the excitement of city living is the variety of cultural activities available. There is a wide assortment of theatre, music and dance performances available in big cities. These things are rare in small ones. 
	The final thing I like about large cities is the diversity of the people. The United States is made up of people of different races, religions, abilities, and interests. However, you seldom find such a variety of people in a smaller town. I think that living in an area where everyone was just like me would quickly become boring. 
	Of course, security is a concern, and that's one area where small towns are superior to big cities. Still, I would rather be a bit more cautious and live in a large city than to feel secure but bored.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Where should we live? Some may choose to live in big cities, while other like the natural and quiet surroundings in countryside. As far as I am concerned, I would like to live in a big city because living in a big city has more advantages than living in countryside. 
	To begin with, the city is the symbol of human civilization and there are a many facilities for living, recreation and health care. Therefore, living there is more convenient than living in countryside. For example, we can find a plenty of malls around our neighborhood, where we can buy everyday necessities at a low price. Furthermore, people concern more about their health and safety than other things in their lives. In big cities, medical facilities and emergency services are easily accessible than in countryside. Big cities also have convenient transportation and utility systems. They also offer faster Internet connections. These all make our life easier in big cities. 
	In addition, we can take part in a variety of events in big cities. Human being likes to live together and need to interact with each other. In a big city, the population density is high therefore there are always plenty of social activities, sports events and concerts. There are more recreational places in big cities, such as opera houses, movie theatres, clubs, and swimming pools. You will have many kinds of entertainment in big cities, and meet many people. In countryside, however, the life may be dull and quite, and you may only have a few neighbors. Living alone with few activities can easily cause mental diseases. 
	Some may argue that the pollution in cities makes people sick. However, with automobiles and modern highways we can easily take a break to expose to fresh air in countryside and sunshine on the beach. 
	In conclusion, I strongly hold that living in big cities is much better than living in countryside because of the advanced facilities and social activities in cities. Moreover, the autos and highways enable us to enjoy the natural and quiet surroundings in countryside.

Essay 3: In English, there is a well-known fairy story about a poor country boy, Dick Whittington, who goes to London because he believes that the streets of that city are “paved with gold”. The story is a tale of “from rags to riches”. Dick eventually becomes the Lord Mayor of London. Like the hero of that story, I always find wonder and adventure in cities. 
	Cities contain a great assortment of people. Whenever I walk around a shopping precinct at midday on a weekend, I am fascinated by all the different types of people hurrying around the shops. Sometimes, I just sit on a public bench and simply watch the variegated streams of shoppers. Today, in the age of globe-trotting transport and communications, city life is more mixed than it has ever been. Capital cities are not cosmopolitan, and eager to attract foreign trade and currency. There is a contemporary English joke which tells that “you can never find an Englishman in London”. 
	Whether rightly or wrongly, governments and local authorities usually build public amenities in the big cities. Money is invested in transport, libraries, parks and museums. Often, countries will compete with each other for the best “show-case” building. Malaysia has built a skyscraper that is taller than is anything in New York. In large countries, region will compete against region: New York against Chicago, Shanghai against Hong Kong and Beijing. 
	All of this is good for the citizen. The magic of the Dick Whittington story is rekindled in me when I enter a library in a magnificent building. If a person is at university studying art or music, a large city usually offers galleries and public performances. Even as a teenager, I appreciated the worth of living in a city because two or three times a year there was a rock concert by a favorite band. 
	Architecture is the urban landscape. If a person has an appreciation of architecture, a city can be as visually exciting as the Himalayas. A modern metropolis is a mountain range of height, light and solidness. And then there are the old buildings: the quaint, unspoiled side-street or shops and homes from a distant age. If a person lived all of his life in one large city, he would continue to discover its architectural secrets into his old age. 
	Man is a 'social animal'. He talks, mixes and creates. Cities offer the libraries, universities and cafe bars for him to meet others of his kind.

Topic 10.	Luck or hard working led to success ? @"When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success." Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.
Essay 1: I fully agree with the claim that there is no correlation between success and luck. Moreover, I understand success to refer to one's ability to achieve the predominant part of his goals in his lifetime, which in turn leads to a correlation between success and income since the accomplishment of such a natural goal as to provide a good future for your loved ones demands the means. What is the simplest and most lawful way to earn enough to consider yourself a successful person? To receive a good education and to find a good job. Both receiving an education and making a career presuppose one's readiness to work hard, and success without hard work is simply not possible for the vast majority of the world's population. The reasons and examples listed below will strengthen my point of view. 
	First of all, considering an education and a career as key factors of success, one will choose to pursue a degree from a college or a university. One wishing to be admitted to the university will have to take several tests. It is doubtful that someone will be so lucky that knowing nothing, he could pass the test with a high score. A low score means failure, and that test taker will not likely be admitted. Therefore, in order to be successful, one should prepare for the tests and work hard, because a good education will provide him with a good job and an opportunity to accomplish some of his goals and dreams. In my lifetime, I have never met a person who could graduate from a college without working hard. 
	Secondly, it is impossible to make a career if one is indolent and lacking knowledge, at least in developed countries. Luck plays no role in achieving this success. Even if someone was unbelievably lucky enough to become a manager not being qualified enough, he will be asked to resign in the near future because of his inability due to lack of knowledge and experience to make right decisions. For instance, I used to work for a very small company owned by a friend. This company was later closed because of bankruptcy. The cause of bankruptcy was wrong strategies and decisions made by the owner. After the failure, he went to a university and worked for another company so that he could obtain experience and become a successful businessman. Nowadays, he considers himself a successful person because he had turned into reality his two biggest dreams of producing consumer goods of high quality and making charitable donations to needy people. 
	In sum, as long as someone understands success as an ability to turn into reality some of his dreams and goals, he will have to work hard because he will need money. And his chances to earn that money will remarkably increase if he could graduate from a college and make a career. All of these things are simply not possible without hard work. Luck has no place in such a scheme of events.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: There is a humorous saying in English – “The grass is always greener on the other side of the valley”. The saying is used ironically to point out that there is a temptation in us all to insist that others are more fortunate than we are. This is nowhere more truly than on the question of luck and hard work. When faced with the “bad times”, we often find comfort in the idea that we are special in our degree of misfortune. I feel that such an attitude is negative, and that it can bring only further misfortune. 
	Many famously successful people have begun from small origins. Mao was the son of a (modestly prosperous) peasant; the explorer Captain Cook was so poor that, as a child, he had to work by day and study by night; many of the affluent Americans of today are the children of the poor immigrants of yesterday. Beethoven, it should be remembered, became deaf before the end of his career. There are many, many more people who have also made genuine, though Jess spectacular, successes against the odds. 
	Within his own terms, a person who is born into poverty in India is a great success if he manages to own a house in later life. Poverty cannot be reduced by merely complaining and blaming others: no matter how guilty other people are, each individual must reach out to success for himself. Indeed, some economists believe that the world operates by what they call “the rule of the jungle”. They believe that in economics a person a1ways attempts to gain profit from his neighbor: that given the chance the poor man would quickly make himself rich by trading to his own advantage. 
	Also, it is presumptuous to judge another according to his or her apparent fortune. No man can ever truly understand the sufferings of his neighbour. A man who appears comfortably rich may have suffered elsewhere in his life - through the death of a loved one, for example. Retired businessmen have often worked long hours in their youth. Surely, it must be wiser to respect achievement than to deny that anyone has achieved good in the world. 
	To rely on notions of luck - to believe that life is a kind of lottery - is an attempt to escape reality. Paradoxically, the only time a person can claim that luck is more important than work is when he reflects on his own success. Because of that modesty, the great man then becomes even greater.

Topic 11.	Giving money to sports and libraries @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Universities should give the same amount of money to their students' sports activities as they give to their university libraries. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.
Essay 1: In my point of view, sports activities are as important as, if not more important than, good libraries. So it is wise for universities to give the same amount of money to their students' sports activities as they give their university libraries. There are numerous clear reasons and I would explore some important ones here. 
	First, good health is the prerequisite for future success. Universities are not only the place for students to expand their minds, but also a place for student to build their body. A good health is very essential for study and future success. In our university, there are several middle-aged teachers and researchers suffer from diseases, some even died when they were still at the acme of their academic achievements. This is a great loss for their families and our university. 
	Second, through sports activities, student can benefit both physically and mentally. Anyone who has played in a football game knows that the cooperation and competition are important for success. They are two basic traits for those who want to succeed, and student who can combine them harmoniously have better chance of success in the future. 
	Third, investment in sports activities can save money in the long run. In China, all of students medical expenses are patronized by government and this is a heavy burden. If the students’ health improved, a lot of money can be saved every year. With these money, universities can build more classrooms, laboratories and libraries. 
	Of course, good libraries are also important for universities. A good library with its large collection of books is the pride and symbol of a prominent university. Both libraries and sports activities are indispensable for university, so it is wise for universities give the same amount of money to their student activities as they give to their libraries.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: I disagree strongly with the idea that the same amount of money should go to university sports activities as to university libraries. Although playing sports is a wonderful way to learn about teamwork, strategy and reaching your goals, it should not be the principal focus of a university education. 
	Students need the most up-to-date library facilities available to get the best education. Many of those facilities are very expensive to buy and maintain. These include computerized programs and access to Internet research databases that students can use to find information all around the world. If a university is only offering its students resources of a decade ago, it's depriving those students of a tremendous amount of information. 
	Even the book and magazine budget of universities has gone up tremendously in the last decade. More is being published on every subject, and every university wants to have this information available to its students. 
	It also costs money for universities to keep their libraries open. Students need to have access to all the libraries' research tools as much of the time as possible. Because students are young and can stay up all night studying, many universities are starting to leave their libraries open all night during exam periods. This costs money, because the staff has to be paid extra to be there. It also costs money to run the building (electricity, heat) during that time. 
	Students at universities are only going to benefit from their education if they can get to all the tools they need to learn. Sports are secondary to the resources that students need from university libraries. For this reason, libraries should always be better funded than sports activities.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Both libraries and sports activities are welcome in the universities. Students could study in the libraries to build up their knowledge. They could get the information that they cannot get in the class. But knowledge is not all for the students. They are willing to have sports frequently. Anyone cannot go on his study without a healthy body. Unfortunately, if we have limited resources to put on the construction and operation of libraries or sport activities, how could we make a decision? I disagree with the statement that universities should give the same amount of money to sports activities as libraries.
	The libraries is necessary part of a university. We cannot imagine a university without any library. Student would like to find books in the library to facilitate their study. The time in the class is very limited. So they could get more academic information in the library. On the other hand, students could enjoy sports outside the campus. Many people just like running, which doesn't need any investment. 
	Considering the operation of the establishments, we should certainly pay more to run a library than the sports activities. With the development of the information of the world, more and more books are published. In order to possess those books, universities must pay a lot money on them. While running a stadium is much more easier. 
	Because university is a place to study, it is natural that more students go to the library. Whenever you go to the library, you will see diligent students studying there. Especially in the examination period, you can hardly find a vacant seat. 
	To sum up, sports activities are very important to students’ health, but if there is limited money, we have to spend more money on libraries than on sports activities. Because libraries are necessities of a university, which need a large amount of money to run, and many students enjoy them.

Topic 12.	Why do people visit museums? @Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: When people travel to new places, they often choose the local museums as a must-see place. Sometimes the museums are even more attractive than the most famous place of interest. This phenomenon can be easily explained if the function of museums is taken into account. As we have known, museums can help us know the history, the customs and the most representative products of that place. 
	Different place has different history. And the most convenient way to know the history is to visit the local museum. Last year when I travelled to Xi’an, an old city, I went to the history museum to explore the course of its development. With the background knowledge provided by the museum, I found that it was easier for me to understand the city. So the museum can clear away the barriers between tourists and the city by making them familiar with its history. To a tourist, the most attractive part of a place is usually its customs, which can be demonstrated by the local museum. In the Beijing custom museum, the real life of typical Beijingers is vividly shown. A tourist can satisfy his curiosity by knowing the origin and characteristics of the quart-yard, the most classical building in Beijing. With the help of museums, tourists can have a deeper understanding of the life of local people. 
	Every place has its own representative products, which are usually handcrafts. Tourists can have the access to a wonderful show of these handcrafts in the local museum. For example, in Jingde town, the most famous pottery-making place in China, tourists can be excited by the beautiful pottery products and the complicated making process exhibited in the pottery museum. It will be a pity for a tourist not to experience the wonderful show of the local products in the museum. 
	In a word, museums serve as a bridge between tourists and the place they travel to. That is why people are so eager to visit museums when they travel to new places.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Museums are presents the whole world left to us, with which we can learn lots of things we did not previously know, be aware of what has happened in the past as well as what is going to happen in the future, or gain self-understanding. Personally, among countless factors which influence the reason for visiting museums, there are three conspicuous aspects as follows. 
	The main reason for my propensity for visiting museums is that more about local histories can be known in this way. Nowadays, many museums are mainly operating for responsibilities to collect, preserve historic treasures and exhibit fine art and antiquities. For instance, the National Museum of Chinese History, the first of these kinds to be established in China has over 300,000 items, including more than 2,000 first-grade pieces items, 100,000 photographs of cultural relics and over 200,000 professional books. As you walk around the General Chinese History exhibition rooms, looking at the cultural relics and imagining the past, you may feel that you are traveling along a path spanning the course of Chinese history. 
	Another reason can be seen by every person is that you can see something rare so much as unique in museums. For example, Emperor QinShihuang, the first emperor in Chinese history, is known as the Emperor Qin’s Terra-cotta Warriors and Horses. Today, the Emperor Qin's Terra-cotta Museum, "the eighth Wonder of the world", is not only a treasure house where the tourists can learn histories, but also a main scenic spot of China. The vivid pottery figures, colorful uniforms and various weapons, acclaimed as the peak of perfection, are unique forever. 
	Furthermore, visiting museums can enrich our knowledge about various sides, such as preventive measures of a disease, the reason of earthquake, man’s region, the latest development of the laser and so on. The inventive genius may be inspired in someone by making exhibits, because knowledge is acquired more easily in this way than being taught in class. 
	Still, people might list other reasons to explain why they always visit museums while traveling to new places, but the three points I have explored in the above discussion, I believe, are most relevant to the issue under discussion.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. By visiting museums, one can learn as much as possible about those places where one visit in a shout time. 
	First of all, one can learn about the history of the places in museums. Today, almost every town in the world has realized the importance to set up their own museums to exhibit historic items which belong to their past. When we visit a new place, we can get almost everything we need about its history in the museums. Last summer vacation, I and several classmates traveled to the city of Taian. At the foot of Mount Tai located a museum about General Feng Yuxiang. After visiting it, we knew a lot about Mr. Feng and what he did to the local people. He was respected by their people, and so did us. 
	Second, visiting museums gives information about local culture. After a long exhausting journey, what a good thing to sit in the museum theatre watching a performance about local culture. When we travel to a new place, especially for a limited time when you cannot go everywhere, so you can get as much information as possible about local culture by visiting museums. 
	What is more, visiting museums gives us a good chance to make new friends. Surely, there are a lot of people will visit museums like us. We can chat with them about what we see and what we hear. At the end of visiting, we sit together to have a cup of coffee and we become good friends. By exchanging telephone number, we can also keep in touch with each other late. What a good experience! 
	In a word, more and more people visit museums when they travel to new places because they want to get more pleasure from their journey.
@Notes: 
Essay 4: People love to visit museums when traveling to new places. I think this is because museums tell them a lot about the culture of those places. Museums are also fun. It's almost impossible to get bored in a museum. Every museum will have at least one thing of interest to somebody. 
	When visiting someplace new, you can find out about the culture of that place in many ways. You can go to a movie or a place of worship or a nightclub. Another option is to sit in the park and listen to the people around you. The easiest way to learn about a-place's culture, though, is by visiting its museums. Museums will show you the history of the place you're visiting. They'll show you what art the locals think is important. If there aren't any museums, that tells you something, too. 
	Museums are fun. Even if you're not interested in art or history, there is always something to get your attention. Many museums now have what they call "hands-on" exhibits. These were originally designed to keep children occupied while their parents were looking at exhibits. However, museums have found that adults enjoy hands-on opportunities just as much as children. These exhibits have activities like pushing a button to hear more about what you're looking at, creating your own work of art, or trying on clothes like those on the models in the museum. 
	People also enjoy visiting museums about unusual subjects. For instance, in my hometown there's a museum devoted to the potato. This museum has art made out of potatoes. It also tells all about the history of the potato, and sells potato mementos like key chains and potato dolls. People enjoy visiting this museum because it's different. It's not something they'd find in their hometown and the museum's curators enjoy talking about the Great Potato. 
	Museums are popular because they are about us. They reflect our creations, our values, and our dreams. No matter who you are or what you like, somewhere there is a museum that will amaze and interest you.
@Notes: 
Essay 5: Do you like to visit a museum when you visit a new place? I'd love to. Because it's an easy way to know the history, the custom, the people, the culture and natural environment there. 
	When you arrive at a place, ask which kind of museum they have. To do this you can know what the people there like. For example, if there are a lot of are museums, the people must like art very much. So you can enjoy an atmosphere of art there. 
	If there is a history museum, it's the best way to know the history of this area. It can tell you when the area was built, whether it has a long history, who came here first, what happened in this area - maybe a revolution or a war, what changed the people's life there, and so on. If you want to know the people there, you must know the history there. Because it's history what affect people's behavior, emotion and custom. If there is a special festival, maybe it's related with a historical affair. 
	Want to visit a nature museum? It's a good idea. There must be introduction about the natural environment there. Why to know that? We can get information about why people there eat this kind of food, maybe it's because of the weather. And where is the best place to visit in this area. 
	Go to visit an art museum. Which kind of art you find there? Modern art? Then it may be a modern place. Classical art? It may be a city with a long history. Maybe you can enjoy an old way of life there. 
	Don't forget the science museum. It can tell you how the people developed their technology, whether the science there is well developed. Do people use new technology to develop this area? If not, it's the best explanation to the question why people there fall behind with people in other areas. 
	So go to a museum, it can tell you about a new place more than you think.
@Notes: 
Essay 6: It is an interesting phenomenon that, when traveling to new places they have never been to before, many people choose to visit museums. Why museums are people's common choice? Based on my personal experience and according to my observations, I think this is because museums tell people a lot about the culture of those places and give them pleasures. 
	It is easy to find out many ways to obtain knowledge about the culture of the place where people visit for the first time. You can go to a theater or worship or a nightclub. Another option is to sit in the park and listen to the people around you. Among various options, visiting museums might be the easiest way. Museums show you the history and art and those things that the locals think important by exhibiting objects and works, some of which might be unique in the world. On the other hand, the museums themselves are part of the landscape of the places. Many museums are designed and built based on the historical and artistic characteristics of the places where the museums are located in. The Forbidden City Museum is the most favorite tourist site because not only it contains a large variety of historical objects and art works but also it is the representative of Chinese history and the highest Chinese ancient architecture achievement. As a result, people are willing to select museums as their first destination to understand culture of the place they visit. 
	Museums also give people pleasure. Even if you are not interested in art or history, there is always something to get your attention. Many museums now have what they call "interactive" exhibits. The "interactive" activities were originally designed to keep children occupied while their parents were looking at exhibits. However, the interesting thing is that adults are keen to these activities as well as their children. It is fascinating to create your own work of painting in an art museum or to design an appearance of a robot by yourself in a science museum. People can be really pleased through performing the "interactive" works in museums, as well as gaining related knowledge. 
	Museums are welcomed by both local people and new comers because they are an essential part of our life. They reflect our history, our art, our values, our creations and our dreams. No matter who you are and what you like, somewhere there is a museum that will amaze and interest you.

Topic 13.	Which place to eat? @Some people prefer to eat at food stands or restaurants. Other people prefer to prepare and eat food at home. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: Some people like to eat out at food stands and restaurants, while others like to prepare food at home. Often it depends on the kind of lifestyle people have. Those with very busy jobs outside the house don't always have time to cook. They like the convenience of eating out. Overall, though, it is cheaper and healthier to eat at home. 
	While eating in restaurants is fast, the money you spend can add up. When I have dinner at a restaurant with a friend, the bill is usually over twenty dollars. I can buy a lot of groceries with that much money. Even lunch at a fast-food stand usually costs five or six dollars for one person. That's enough to feed the whole family at home. 
	Eating at home is better for you, too. Meals at restaurants are often high in fat and calories, and they serve big plates of food-much more food-than you need to eat at one meal. If you cook food at home, you have more control over the ingredients. You can use margarine instead of butter on your potatoes, or not put so much cheese on top of your pizza. At home, you can control your portion size. You can serve yourself as little as you want. In a restaurant, you may eat a full plate of food "because you paid for it." 
	It's true that eating out is convenient. You don't have to shop, or cook, or clean up. But real home cooking doesn't have to take up a lot of time. There are lots of simple meals that don't take long to make. In fact, they're faster than eating out, especially if you think of the time you spend driving to a restaurant, parking, waiting for a table, waiting for service, and driving home. 
	Both eating at restaurants and cooking at home can be satisfying. Both can taste good and be enjoyed with family and friends. I prefer cooking at home because of the money and health issues, but people will make the choice that fits their lifestyle best.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: In the modern life now, more and more people prefer to eat at food stands or restaurants. They think that will save time so that they can have enough time to do their jobs. But I still prefer to prepare and eat food at home. 
	There several reasons. First of all, you can save money if you eat at home. In general, to get profit, the restaurants ask for more money on the same food you cook at home. That is the waste of money. To save money, you may prefer to prepare you food at home with less money. 
	The second, usually, the food in the restaurants is not what you are expecting. You may dislike the way the restaurant cook the same dishes as you do at home. For example, the other day, I asked for potato in a restaurant. After the first bite, I thought it was so awful. My mom never cooked such potato for me! The bad lunch even destroyed my mood in that day. 
	The third, if you prepare food by yourself, you will have a happy mood when you eat it, regardless of the real savor of the food. It goes a saying well "labor brings happiness”. In addition, you can change your method of cooking considering your taste on that day. 
	The reasons above may can answer why I prefer to eat food at home. Cooking even has become my hobby now. Come back and have your delicious food, I'm sure you will like it!
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Nowadays, some people like to eat at home and prepare food for themselves, but others have a negative attitude that they prefer to eat out side in restaurant or at foodstands. As far as I am concerned, it is better to eat at home. There are numerous reasons why I hold on, and I would explore only a few primary ones here. 
	I t cannot be denied that there is some advantage to the first points. Firstly, the condition of the restaurant is more comfortable and the food of there is more delicious usually. Then eating in restaurant become a good choice of getting together with friends. In addition, eat out side take people convenience and shortcut. For the people who are busy on working, prepare food for they will make troubles and waste time. For the young person who are not able to cook for themselves, eat at foodstands resolve the problem. 
	The main reason for my propensity for eating at home is that eat at home and prepare food for themselves can enhance the emotion among the member of family and bring pleasure to everyone. In modern society, everyday, parents are busy on working and sociality, and children are busy on study and playing. For convenience and saving time, they often choice eat out side. Then there left so few time of them to share. Sharing the dinner at home is not only eating but also provide a chance to talking, making joke and exchange feeling with each other. Maybe someone think that make dinner is a heavy burden. But I believe prepare food with family is also a happy, likely have dinner with family is a pleasure. With your sisters and brothers help your mother do a meal in weekend, and enjoy the food, and you will feel everything is so nice. 
	Another reason is that I think that eat at home is more economical than go to restaurant and save money. Using the same number of money you can buy more and better food from shop than from restaurant. You can do nourishing meal for your children rather than the junk food from foodstands. And you can spend the saved money on many the other way, such as buy new clothes and see a movie. 
	General speaking, eat out side is comfortable and convenience to our live, while eat at home can share happy with family. Taking into account of all these, I prefer to prepare food for ourselves and eat at home.

Topic 14.	Attending classes @Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.
Essay 1: Nowadays, it becomes a heatedly debated topic whether a student should be required to attend classes or not. Some people hold the opinion that the university students should be required to go to classes. However, others have a negative attitude. If I were forced to agree with one of the two positions, I would stand behind the latter. My Arguments for this point are listed as follows. 
	I agree with the statement that going to classes should be optional for university students without reservation since I believe a student is supposed to attend those classes he or she is interested in. Naturally, interest is the mother of study. When attracted by a wonderful class, you will attend it unforcedly and immediately. Nevertheless, not all classes are so popular in reality and no one has interest in every class. Consequently, you should select the classes you like to attend for a higher efficiency of studying. It can be given a good example, in current universities, many excellent students almost have the record of skipping some boring and undesirable classes. 
	Another reason that can be seen by everyone is that it contributes to build a university student's ability of learning by himself or herself. Obviously, by choosing good and meaningful classes, giving up those undesirable, or studying these classes you cannot attend somehow by yourself, you will learn how to distribute your study time and acquire the capability of learning by yourself, which is tremendously important to modern university students. Many celebrities, such as Bill Gates, have such powerful ability by not attending some classes when they were in university. 
	Admittedly, being required to attend classes has advantages of disciplining the student, however, considering most university students can discipline themselves on their own, I believe it is sagacious to agree with that going to classes should be optional for college or university students.

Essay 2: Should university students be required to attend classes? There are two different opinions. Some people claim that attending classed is a must to students. Other people, however, argue that it should be for students to decide whether they want to go to class or not. As far as I am concerned, no matter whether students like it or not, they must attend classes. 
	Students who don't like to go to classes have their reasons. The main one is, they can learn knowledge by themselves. If they were asked to attend the class in which the professor teaches something they already have known, it would be a pain. Not attending class, students can control their time more freely and are likely not to waste time. 
	Although I agree that there may be one or two advantages to not attending class, I insist that the advantages of joining classes far overweigh them. In the first place, professors can teach students a lot of things that cannot be obtained from books. In Chinese dictionary, a university is defined to be a place where teachers forward what they know to students. In the book, normally there is just concentrated knowledge. How the writer gets and develops it is a question. How to answer this question? Go to the class. The professor will not only teach you some knowledge, but also let you know how to use and develop it. As a Chinese slang says, “Owning a key is owning a house." That is the most important reason people want to study in university. 
	In the second place, you will be benefited from discussing with your classmates if attending classes. Different people have their own special capability. One people cannot be good at every aspect. What is the best way to share your knowledge with others and learn from others? Go to the class. Professor always gives some topics for students to discuss. In the discussion, you will be surprised that so many great fresh thoughts are pushing to you from your colleagues and they are free. 
	In conclusion, I believe that students should attend classes not only because professors can teach you the method of how to master and develop knowledge, but also because students can learn from each other in the class. In short, attend classes if you select to attend university.

Essay 3: Some people may believe that going to classes should be optional, but I disagree. I don't understand how university students can expect to learn anything if they don't attend classes. Personal experience can help people learn about themselves and the world outside the classroom, but when it comes to learning about academic subjects, students need to be in class. 
	In class they receive the benefit of the teacher's knowledge. The best teachers do more than just go over the material in the class textbook. They draw their students into discussion of the material. They present opposing points of view. They schedule guest speakers to come, give the students additional information, or show documentary films on the subject. 
	Also, attending classes on any subject teaches more than just facts. It teaches students how to learn, how to absorb information and then apply what they've learned to other situations. Their teacher is the best one to help them with these skills. They can't learn them just by reading the textbook. 
	Going to class also teaches students how to work with the other members of the class. Many times students will be given group assignments. This is different from what they did in secondary school. Here they're with people from different backgrounds and experiences. In this situation, they learn how to handle working with people different from themselves to achieve a common goal. 
	Going to class also teaches students responsibility and discipline. Having to be at a particular place at a particular time prepares them for getting a job. Being at that place on time with an assignment completed prepares them for a career. 
	In short, by going to class students learn more than just information from the teacher. They also learn how to learn, how to work with others, and how to work responsibly. These are not optional skills in life, so attending classes should not be optional in college.

Topic 15.	The qualities of a good neighbor @Neighbors are the people who live near us. In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good neighbor? Use specific details and examples in your answer.
Essay 1: If you have a good neighbor, you are a lucky person. You have someone who cares about your needs and your property, who is helpful in the little day-to-day situations that come up, and who is supportive in times of crisis. 
	A good neighbor is someone who, for instance, understands that your children may occasionally run across his lawn - even though you tell them not to. He'll realize that children can be careless about things like that, and he won't make a big fuss about it unless it becomes a regular thing. In the same vein, he knows that you'll understand if some of the trash from his trash cans blows across into your yard. In other words, he is sensitive to the unintentional things that can happen. He doesn't make a big deal about them. 
	A good neighbor is also respectful of your property. For example, she asks your permission before doing anything that interferes with what's yours. This means she wouldn't plant a huge tree in between your houses without asking how you felt about it. If she wanted to put up a fence, she would let you know first. She might work with you to decide where it should be placed. Maybe the two of you would even split the cost. 
	A good neighbor would lend you some milk if you ran out. She'd give you a ride to work if your car was broken, and let your children stay at her house in the evening if you got stuck working overtime. You would do the same for her. Both of you would help make the other's life easier. 
	When something really awful happens to you, like a death in the family, a good neighbour will volunteer to help in any way he can. This could mean something small, like making some casseroles to put in your freezer to feed visiting relatives. Or it could mean something big, like helping you get through the sadness of the funeral. 
	I think only someone who has experienced a bad neighbour can really appreciate a good one! A good neighbour can be a good friend. He or she can make all the difference in the world to your life.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Neighbours are the people who live near us, and their behaviour influence our daily life. Good neighbours can make us feel comfortable and give us many help, and everyone will benefit from a good relationship among neighbours. In my point of view, these are three conspicuous aspects of the qualities of a good neighbours. 
	One of the most important characteristic of good neighbours is that they have a good living habit and are friendly to others. A person with bad habit will affect your daily life. For example, children are most likely to be influenced by bad neighbours and carry on bad habits. On the other hand, being friendly is also an important nature of good neighbours. If neighbours are unfriendly, they are hard to approach and difficult to get along with. 
	Another important aspect of good neighbors is that they should be willing to help others. In our daily life, emergency situations may happen, and we may encounter difficulties which cannot be resolved by ourselves. At this time, the quickest help we can get is probably from our neighbors. To some degree, neighbours are as important as relatives to us, because they could provide the immediate help. In the same way, a neighbour who likes to help others will get help in return. Help each others can form a friendly and harmonious relationship among the neighbours. 
	All in all, a good neighbour is someone who have a good living habit, is friendly and is willing to help others. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that a good relationship among neighbours need the maintenance from us.

Topic 16.	Building a new restaurant @It has recently been announced that a new restaurant may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.
Essay 1: I can see both advantages and disadvantages to having a new restaurant built in our neighborhood. I'm worried about traffic and how it will affect our neighbourhood. However, I think that it will benefit local businesses and increase appreciation for our neighborhood. Overall, I think it is a good idea. 
	Traffic congestion is always a concern when you build something new. Our streets are narrow, with parking on both sides. More cars traveling through the neighbourhood could cause a lot of congestion. Traffic means parking problems, too. Our neighborhood has very few garages attached to the houses. Most of us depend on finding a space to park on the street. If the new restaurant is built, we'll be competing for those spaces with the restaurant's patrons. Plus, if the restaurant offers valet parking, it'll be even worse. Valet parkers work in teams to grab every possible space available on the street. 
	I'm also concerned about the type of patrons this new restaurant will bring into our neighbourhood. A family restaurant wouldn't be a problem. However, if it's going have a bar and dancing, then there could be problems. The restaurant would stay open later, and people leaving the restaurant might be drunk. Who wouldn't worry about rowdy customers staggering around our neighbourhood in the early morning hours, looking for their cars? 
	I have to admit, though, there are advantages to a new restaurant. Our neighborhood could certainly use the jobs the restaurant would provide. Not only that, the money neighborhood residents would earn there would likely be spent at other neighborhood businesses. This would give a boost to those businesses and make our neighborhood more prosperous. 
	A new restaurant would also attract a lot of people to our neighborhood. They could see what a nice area this is to live. That might attract new residents to the neighbourhood. That would be a good thing, because we've been losing residents to the suburbs the last couple of years. 
	There are a lot of details to consider, but all in all, I support the idea of this new restaurant in our neighbourhood.

Topic 17.	Learning by yourself or with a teacher? @Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than with a teacher. Others think that it is always better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.
Essay 1: Most of us can learn how to do something simple on our own with just a set of instructions. However, to learn about something more complex, it's always best to have a teacher. 
	Teachers bring with them varied and useful backgrounds. They've been trained to teach individuals in different ways depending on their style. For instance, some students learn better by discussing a topic. Others learn more by writing about it. Teachers can help students learn in the way that's best for each student. A textbook or a manual can only give you one way of learning something. Plus they're only as helpful as your ability to understand them. A good teacher can adapt her teaching to your needs. 
	Teachers help you focus on what you're learning. If you're learning something by yourself, it's easy to become distracted and go on to other activities. Teachers keep your attention on the subject. They also approach a subject logically, taking it one step at a time. On your own, it's tempting to skip parts of the learning process you think you don't need. That can hinder your ability to really understand the subject. 
	Learning a subject on your own is a very narrow way of learning. You can only use the information you get from the textbook. With a teacher, you get the information in the written materials as well as the teacher's own knowledge of the topic. Teachers can also provide extra materials to broaden the scope of what you're learning. 
	There's nothing wrong with studying on your own, and a learner can always benefit from some quiet study. For the best possible learning, though, a good teacher is the biggest help you can have.

Topic 18.	A good supervisor @What are some important qualities of a good supervisor (boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.
Essay 1: Even though job situations can be very different, there are several qualities that all good supervisors have in common. A good boss treats all her employees fairly. She doesn't single out one employee for better (or worse) treatment than the others. A poor supervisor has favourites. Sometimes she'll even use her favorites to spy on other employees. She expects them to tell her what the others are saying about her. This can cause a lot of bad feelings among employees. 
	A good supervisor gives clear and understandable directions, she doesn't constantly change her mind about what she wants employees to do. She also doesn't get angry with an employee who is confused and needs her to explain the directions again or more fully. Delegating authority well is another quality of a good supervisor. She knows how to use the skills of her employees to best advantage. A poor supervisor insists on doing everything herself. She is unwilling to give any authority to others. 
	A good boss evaluates her employees on a reasonable set of criteria, not on how she feels about them personally. And she lets the employees know what those criteria are, so they have a fair chance of meeting them. She gives both praise and criticism in a straightforward manner. She also offers guidance when needed. A poor supervisor will criticize without giving any suggestions on how to improve. 
	Most importantly, a good supervisor sets the standards for her employees by her own behavior. She works hard and treats employees like valuable assets to the company. This promotes good morale among her workers, and this is of great benefit to her business.

Topic 19.	Improve roads or public transportation @Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.
Essay 1: Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways or on improving public transportations? There seems to be a difficult problem since many reasons should be involved. However, after carefully pondering it, I buttress the last one, spending the money on improving public transportation. The reasons are presented below: 
	There is no denying that improving the public transportation will surely alleviate the pollution given off by enormous cars. If a city has not a developed public transportation, the air will be polluted more heavily. What a dirty environment we will live in! Every day breathing into the air filled with the flour of the gasoline, seeing the sky with the dull color will be the title of our life. So the essence of environment has been realized by an increasingly number of people, to the governments, the protection of environment is especially an undeniable mission. 
	Another reason I agree with it is that developed public transportation will decrease the frequency of the traffic jams. Perhaps no worse word than “traffic jams” exists, to the businessmen who believe in “Time is money”. Traffic jams not only cost the people time and expense, but also create a bad mood for work. It greatly decreases the efficiency of the whole city. I imagine how can a city whose avenue full of traffic jams develop its economics? 
	Finally, I want to say that improving the public transportation provide a great number of ways of transportation for most of the poor people who cannot afford to buy a car. It is known that our citizens is not made of only people who has the ability to own a car, but the very poor people are also included. I believe that however the technology is improved, the public apparatus should not be ignored, because it serves the people all over the city. 
	Nevertheless, the private transportation has its own advantages, for instance, it can save a lot of time in some cases, provide some convenience for people. But improving on roads and highways is advantageous only conditionally. Based on the above discussion, I agree with the opinion that the government should spend money on improving public transportation not only it can protect environment and save time for people, but it also can create a convenient environment for all the citizens.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Governments should definitely spend more money on improving all forms of public transportation. These include buses, subways and trains. This is the best way to preserve natural resources and reduce pollution. 
	As a planet, we're dealing with a finite amount of natural resources. Once they're gone, they can't be replaced. They can't fill our need for oil and gasoline forever. But we seem to forget that and consume them at an incredible rate. In wealthier countries, some families have two or three cars. As soon as teenagers get their driver's licenses, they're given cars so their parents won't have to drive those places. 
	Public transportation hasn't been sufficiently developed. Because of this, suburban areas surrounding cities have been allowed to sprawl more and more widely. This means that people can't even go to the store without having to hop into the car. Everything is too far away from where they live. If there were better and more frequent public transportation, people would be able to give up their cars for local driving. 
	As a result of all the cars being driven, we're dealing with terrible pollution problems. In big cities, there are days during the summer when the elderly and people with respiratory problems are advised not to leave the house. Ten years ago this was unheard of! Now it's the norm. Public transportation would cut down considerably on air pollution. 
	Public transportation also encourages a sense of community. People who travel to work together all the time get to know each other. Cars isolate us from our neighbors. However, people feel they need to drive because they can't depend on public transportation to fit their schedules. If more money were available, buses, subways and trains could run 24 hours a day. Then they would be available all the time to the people who need them. 
	I always try to take public transportation whenever possible, and I encourage friends and neighbors to try it to. I think we must support public transportation in order to create a better world.

Topic 20.	Which place for children to grow up? @It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.
Essay 1: With the development of the transportation system and some residence institution, the world is getting smaller and smaller, and people are not restricted in only one area. In addition to the convenient condition, because there are different places with different cultures, living standards, education environment and other disparity, they are inclined to transfer from one place to the other. Is it better to move around than stay in one place? I believe there are no uniform answers, but in my opinion, I do agree with the claim that to move around is better than to stay in one place. 
	Most people’s growth comes with the transfers in their life. As for me, when I was young I lived in a small county. Because the school in there was not suitable to me, I transferred from my little county to a city to get a better education. As soon as I got to the city, I was amazed that the world here was so different here as my hometown .If I still lived in my hometown, it was impossible for me to make the wildest guess at what the real world looked like. The first transfer has made me to imagine my own life and spur on me to go further. With the confidence, I went into a university which I would never think of it before. The university is located in a different city so that I have to come into another world. Compared with my living city, the one is more complicated in which there are different people, more convenient transportation, more competitive environment. I love all of this very much. Communicating with different students and teachers, I have learned much from them which will benefit me throughout my life and my lifestyle. Now I am in a graduate school also so beautiful that I will never regret my selection of leaving my hometown because the transfer has given me a splendid life. 
	Also, like we students, there are many adults transferring their work place in order to grasp better opportunities. No matter in industry, in agriculture or in service, workers have rights to choose their work companies which leads them to work from place to place and then they accumulate precious experience and skills to get priorities to others. 
	People not only transfer in their own country, but also go abroad to get education, work or live through the rest of their life in appropriate countries. We can see that many students including me want to go to the foreign countries to study further and forge ourselves, and that many parents send their little sons or daughters to foreign countries to study. After all, diverse circumstances give persons new experience and broaden their narrow sight, even help them get more comprehensive understanding of the world, the society and our life itself. 
	However, some people may say that if people move around, they will pay for much such as money, time and energy. It is right to say that it takes one person some time to get used to his or her new environment, new personal relationship which indeed influences the growth of children, the efficiency of our work and the stability of our society and family. And I have to admit that people should make considerate plans before changing their places and may not transfer aimlessly and frequently. But I think sometimes it is just all the friction that has made the world wealthier and more beautiful. Therefore, I still think it is better to travel around than to live in one place.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: There are advantages and disadvantages to a childhood in either the country or a city. It's hard to say which is better. Growing up in the country means a certain amount of isolation. You're in a small town or on a farm and not with a lot of people. Even more important, the people you meet every day tend to be just like you. Most will be the same race as you, have the same background as you, and will have gone to the same schools as you. In the city, the people you meet are all different. There are different races and different cultures. You get a more interesting mix. 
	City people tend to come from a lot of different places and move around a lot. So, there isn't the sense of community in the city that you have in the country. People in the city can live in the same apartment building for twenty years and never get to know their neighbors. In the country, everybody knows everybody. For a child, this means the country is more secure. A child can get lost or hurt in the city and have no one to turn to. In the country, everyone's a neighbor. People in the country feel connected to each other. 
	A child growing up in the city has the advantage of a lot of interesting and exciting places to visit. He or she can go to the zoo, museums, art galleries and concerts. There are a lot of restaurants with different kinds of food. It's easy to see every new movie that comes out. Children in the country don't have a lot of these activities nearby. 
	All in all, I think a childhood in the city is better because it prepares you more for what real life is like.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Where is a better place for children to grow up, the countryside or the big city? The answer to this question differs from individual to individual. As far as I am concerned, it is better for children to grow up in a big city. 
	Some people argue that the countryside is an ideal place for children to grow up. For one thing, it is less polluted than the city. The air is fresh in the countryside. The sky is bluer and the water is clearer. Living in such a place is good to the children’s health. For another, as children like playing, only the countryside can satisfy them well. They can run everywhere, play games in the field, swim in the river. On the contrary, the city cannot provide such places for children. Maybe they can only stay at home and watch TV. 
	Although I do agree that growing up in the countryside has one or more advantages, I insist that it is far better to choose the city as the right place for children. To begin with, living in the city can broaden their horizons. They can meet a lot of people and hear a number of things that will never happen in the countryside. 
	In addition, city means more chance to receive better education. In most countries, it is no doubt that the education level in the city is higher than that of the country. As a result, children can meet better teachers and receive high quality of education in the city. 
	Last but not least, children can also develop many hobbies in the city. They can learn to play the piano, draw and so on, which are impossible in the country. 
	In conclusion, I believe that it is better for children to grow up in the city not only because it can broaden their horizons, but also because they can receive better education and have a chance to develop many hobbies there.

Topic 21.	People are living longer now @In general, people are living longer now. Discuss the causes of this phenomenon. Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.
Essay 1: With the development of human society, people are living longer now. Many factors interacting together to enable the longer life. There are three most important causes: the quality of food has been greatly improved; people could have medical services; more and more people realize that regular sports benefit their health. 
	The improving quality of our food is the most important factor of the longer life. We could have not only enough food as we want, but also the healthier food. When we preparing food, we no longer consider the cost, but pay more attention to the nutrition of the food. With the development of transportation systems, inland people now could also enjoy seafood and tropical fruit. 
	Furthermore, governments are paying more and more money on medical establishments. Citizens could have medical services more easily. Because of the convenient medical service more illnesses could be detected at an earlier stage. Also, many illnesses that had been considered fatal could be cured today. The better detection and treatment enable people's longer life. 
	Last but not least important is that people care more for their own health. Every morning you could see people doing sports outside. More and more people have realized the saying "life is locomotion". Regular sports build up a strong body. Naturally, people with stronger body could resist more diseases. 
	To sum up, the development of our society causes the longer life of people. People have better food and better medical services. And people spend more time on sports to build up stronger bodies. As we could predict, people are going to live even longer.

Essay 2: Nowadays, more and more communities for old people are founded everywhere all over the world. When you walk in a department store, you will find that more and more products for old people have been put on the shelves. The population of old people in the world is growing rapidly, and the reason is people are living longer now. There are several explanations for this phenomenon. 
	First, under the development of science and technology, it’s obviously the standards of living have been improved a lot. People work less and relax more these days than ten years ago. More entertainment has also been provided, hence people have more chances to entertain and keep a good mood everyday, which is essential for being healthy and living longer. 
	Moreover, highly developed health system is another significant factor for people to live for a long time. As the governments put more fund for health expenditure, more people are saved from the torture of illness. 
	Furthermore, the improvement in medicine also plays an important role. There’s an undeniable fact that after people discovered the mysteries of gene, more and more newly developed medicine cured a lot of illness that can’t be cured before. Besides all these explanations we discussed above, there are also many other reasons. But the main causes of people’s longer life is the development of science and technology, efficient health system and improvement in medicine.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: With the development of modern medicine, people are living longer now. There are many factors why people can live a longer life. In my opinion, there are three most important reasons: the quality of food has been greatly improved; people benefit from improved medical services; and more and more people realize the importance of regular sports and exercises to their health. 
	The improving quality of our food is the most important factor for a longer life. With the convenience of modern transportation and food processing technology, we can find any food in the market; and as our standard of living and income increases, we can effort to buy any kind of food we want. We no longer worry about the cost, but pay more attention to the nutritious balance of the food. Better food and better nutrition give us a healthier body. 
	Furthermore, the development of medical technology and method ensure a longer life for people. Many fatal deceases which were considered incurable before can now be treated and cured. Governments are paying more and more money on medical care and training of doctors and nurses. People can access medical services easily: regular physical examinations ensure that deceases can be found earlier and therefore can be treated in a timely fashion. 
	Last but not least, people care more about their own health and realised the importance of exercises to their health. Every morning you could see people doing sports outside. More and more people have realized the saying "Life is locomotion". Regular sports build up a strong body. Sports like hiking, jogging, and swimming can all benefit our health. Naturally, people with stronger body could resist more diseases, and therefore can live longer. 
	To sum up, the progress of our society is the reason why people live a longer life now. People eat food and have access to better medical services. And people spend more time on sports and exercises to build stronger bodies. As we could predict, people are going to live even longer in the future.
@Notes: 
Essay 4: Today people are living to be much older than ever before. Some of the main reasons for this are the improved health care and better nutrition available to everyone. 
	Medical care is more available to people. Although not everyone can get the best health care, everyone can get basic health care and advice. When people are seriously ill, they can go to a public hospital and be taken care of. Years ago, health care wasn't available to everyone. Some people didn't live near a doctor or a hospital, and others couldn't pay for the care they needed. They made do with herbal medicines or folk remedies. Of course, some of these worked, but not for the more serious diseases. 
	The quality of medical care has improved. That's also a factor in longevity. Doctors know more now about what causes disease and how to cure it. Years ago, doctors only knew about the most basic diseases and cures. Medicine was not very advanced. You could die from something as simple as an infection from a cut. Now we have antibiotics and other medicines to help cure infections. 
	People are also living longer now because of better nutrition. We're eating better and more healthfully than we used to. That's reduced the number of people with heart disease and cancer. We try to eat low-fat foods and eat more vegetables and fruits, which are now available year-round. 
	Improved medical care and healthy eating habits has greatly expanded our life spans. What we need to do now is make 'sure that everyone in the world has these benefits.

Topic 22.	Some characteristics of a co-worker @We all work or will work in our jobs with many different kinds of people. In your opinion, what are some important characteristics of a co-worker (someone you work closely with)? Use reasons and specific examples to explain why these characteristics are important.
Essay 1: We spend more time with our co-workers during a week than we do with our family. Thus, it's important for our co-workers to be people we can get along with. I've worked in a lot of offices, and I've found there are certain characteristics that all good co-workers have in common. 
	A good co-worker is very cooperative. She does her best to get along with others. She tries to keep her end of things flowing smoothly to help others in the office. She realizes that if one person doesn't get her work done, it can hold up everyone else. She has a positive attitude that creates a pleasant working environment. 
	A good co-worker is adaptable. She is not stubborn about changes in schedules or routines, and doesn't object to having her job description revised. That can make life miserable for everyone around her. A good co-worker is willing to change her schedule to accommodate another worker's emergency. She has no problem with new procedures and welcomes changes when they come. A good co-worker is helpful. She pitches in when someone falls behind in his or her work. She's willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done. She doesn't keep track of how often she has to finish another's work or take on extra work. Some co-workers do their own job, period. They have no sense of office community. They only want to do their work, get paid and go home. 
	A good co-worker is a sympathetic listener, and never uses what she learns against people. She doesn't gossip. A bad co-worker uses negative rumours to take advantage of others. 
	Being a good co-worker isn't too hard, but some people just can't seem to manage it. Wouldn't it be a wonderful world if everyone could?
@Notes: 
Essay 2: We all work with many different kinds of people. Different co-workers have different personality. To me, my co-workers should have some important characteristics such as independence, optimism, and teamwork spirit. 
	I think a good co-worker must have his own opinions. A co-worker should dare to propose his own opinions. He should not say the same as others and hide his opinions. Only everyone tries his best to analyse every aspect of a thing, it can be done best. So independence of thinking is important for a co-worker. 
	Another important characteristic is optimism. If we have some difficult problems, he must be brave and should not fear them. He should encourage others to find methods to solve problems. This point is very important because one’s mood can influence others easily. Once a co-worker shows a little fear of difficulties, others may become discouraged soon. So a good co-worker should be optimistic. 
	In addition, teamwork spirit is an important characteristic of a co-worker. Although a co-worker should be independent to analyse a thing, he should be tolerant to the different people and their ways of working. He should be willing to dedicate his energy, time and knowledge to reach the goal of whole team. 
	Independence, optimism and teamwork spirit are important characteristics of a co-worker. If everyone in a work group has these characteristics, the group can overcome difficulties and reach its goals.

Topic 23.	Having jobs while still students @In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your opinion by using specific reasons and details.
Essay 1: I don't think it is a good idea for teenagers to have jobs while they are still students. It can interfere with their studies, it can disrupt their home life, and it takes away pan of their childhood that they can never replace. 
	Education today is very complex and difficult. In order to learn and get good grades, a student must work very hard and concentrate. This means attending classes from early in the morning until late afternoon, then doing research for projects, then going home and doing homework. It's a busy schedule for anyone. For someone trying to hold down a job, it's even harder. Students need all their energy for their studies. If they're working after class at night, they're going to be tired the next day. They won't be able to concentrate. This will have a negative impact on their learning, and eventually on their grades. 
	Having a job can also disrupt a teenager's home life. Families spend less and less time together. If a teenager has a job to go to after school, he won't be home for dinner. He won't be home after dinner, either, and may not get home until late at night. This means he doesn't have a lot of time to spend with his family. If he doesn't have a car, it can mean changes in his parents' schedules, too. They have to drive him to work and pick him up. 
	The main drawback of a teenager having a job while he's still a student is that he's missing out on the fun of being young. He has a whole lifetime in which he'll have to earn a living. This is the last free time he'll have. It's the last chance he'll have to hang out with friends and just enjoy himself. Soon enough he'll have to worry about paying the rent and buying food. 
	Jobs bring money, but money isn't everything. A teenager with a job gives up too much. No one should spend all his time at work, and especially not a teenager.

Topic 24.	Living in your town or city @A person you know is planning to move to your town or city. What do you think this person would like and dislike about living in your town or city? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.
Essay 1: If a person I know is planning to move to my city, what this person would like and dislike about living in my city? It is an interesting question for me. Frankly speaking, living in my city - Taipei for a long time, I never thought of such a question before I started to write this essay. In my point of view, there are many good sites about this city and my friend will enjoy living here. 
	First, Taipei is a city where have lots of job opportunities. Job opportunities is very important when an outsider wants to start a new life in a city. Taipei, as everybody knows, has many factories, companies and international headquarters. With superior urban environment and infrastructure, Taipei not only attracted many foreign institutions, but also many domestic investors to set their offices and build their factories here. Therefore, you can find many job vacancies on the web or newspapers in Taipei. 
	Second, Taipei is a place where you can learn what you want to learn. There are so many colleges, schools, training classes in Taipei. The learning opportunities is available all year round. If you want to learn English composition, there are a lot of schools and classes for you to choose. If you want to learn dancing, you can join one of many dancing clubs in the park, where teachers teach people dancing for free. 
	Last but not least, you never feel bored in Taipei. There are so many places where you can go, and so many activities that you can do. When you get up in the morning, you can go to the nearest coffee shop and enjoy drinking a cup of coffee. Or you can choose to eat Chinese foods. There always have a variety of thing for you to choose. If you feel upset, you can go to night pub, listening some tender music. 
	Take what I have mentioned above into consideration, living in my home town is a great pleasure. I think my friend will like living in my home town.

Essay 2: A friend of mine from college is moving to my city, so I have been thinking about what she would and wouldn't like about it. I'd say the quality of life here, as far as fun and activities are concerned, is very good. The quality of life isn't very good, though, in other important ways.
	Living in a large city is exciting, but you pay a price for it. There are lots of interesting things to do, and good restaurants with food from around the world. There are museums, art galleries, and lots of movie theatres. However, the crime rate is high, and people have to be careful about where they go at night. There's a lot of traffic most of the time, and finding a parking space can be a problem. There are also a lot of people living here. Sometimes it feels too crowded. 
	In a big city like mine, housing is very expensive. It costs a lot even if you're just renting an efficiency apartment. The good side is that there's a lot of choice about where you want to live and how you want to live. You can find apartments of all sizes in different settings. Houses of equal variety are available for sale or rent. 
	If my friend likes the great outdoors, she might be disappointed. Unfortunately, my city doesn't have a lot of wide open green spaces, 'and there aren't a lot of trees on the streets. We're not near the ocean, and the mountains are a day's drive from here. Still, we do have some natural areas. For example, we have a beautiful big park. It even has a lake in the middle that's used for ice skating in the winter. There's a different kind of beauty in the city. 
	Thinking about it, I suppose whether my friend likes my city will depend on whether or not she likes exciting places. I hope she likes a lot of variety as far as housing and activities are concerned. If she does, then this is the place for her.

Essay 3: Recently one of my friends will move to Shanghai from New Zealand and she asked me which aspects she might not adapt in Shanghai. I think that it is as follows: 
	Firstly, she may think that the air pollution is very severe in Shanghai. As everyone knows that New Zealand is a developed country known for its beautiful natural environment. There are fewer industry plants in New Zealand than in Shanghai. So New Zealand is a very clean and beautiful country, just like a garden. However, in Shanghai the air pollution is still out of control. When you come back home from your company every day, you will find that your shoes are covered with dusts. 
	What is more, my friend may find that the streets in Shanghai is very crowded with traffic. The population of Shanghai is 13 million, which is much more than that of New Zealand. She might find uncomfortable travelling in the streets of Shanghai during rush hours. 
	Finally, I think that she may complain about some other small things about Shanghai. For example, suppose she walks on the pavement and will find that there are too many bicycles parked on it which block the sidewalk. Sometimes she has to walk on the street. I think having lived in New Zealand for a long time, these small things in Shanghai may bewilder her. 
	In a word, I think that my friend will dislike the air pollution, crowded transportation and other aspects of Shanghai. As a Shanghaiese, I think we all should try our best to make Shanghai a better place to live in the future.

Topic 25.	Building a shopping center @It has recently been announced that a large shopping center may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.
Essay 1: There are both advantages and disadvantages of establishing a shopping mall in our neighborhood. I am worried about traffic and how it will affect our community. However, I believe it will benefit local business and increase appreciations for local area. All in all, I think it is a good idea. 
	For those what I am worried about, traffic congestion and parking problem are obverse. First of all, traffic congestion is always a concern when building something new. Our streets are narrow, with parking on both sides. A shopping center will certainly bring more traffic than ever before, and heavy traffic means big congestion. At the same time, parking is also a problem in this area. There are few garages attached to houses. Most of residents depend on finding spaces on the street for parking. If a shopping mall is build, we must compete with customers and patrons for those parking spaces. Furthermore, if the shopping center offers valet parking service, it would be even worse because valet parking works in terms to grab every possible spaces available in street. 
	On the other hand, building up a shopping center will give this neighborhood more opportunities and benefits. Residents in this area could certainly take the job that shopping center offers. People would earn more money and spend on other business, such as entertainment and education, which are operating in our neighborhood or adjacent communities. As a result, not only local business but also inter-community business boosts up and a prodigious amount of fortune will be accumulated to our neighborhood. A shopping center can also attract people to visit our community. When they drive to the shopping center, they will see what a nice place this area is to live. Therefore, we would have an increasing number of residents in the next couple of years. It is very important to introduce new numbers because we have lost many residents to suburbs during recent years. 
	In a short, there are several details to consider when planning a shopping center. In my part, I support to have a new shopping center in my community because its advantages outweigh disadvantages.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: There would be both advantages and disadvantages to having a shopping center built in my neighborhood. One advantage would be the convenience. I would like to have all those stores close by. Shopping would be much easier and faster because I wouldn't have to drive great distances to get to the stores. 
	A shopping center, would mean more choices, because there would be more stores selling different products. I might have a movie theater nearby, because so many shopping centers these days include movie theaters in their plans. Most shopping centers also have restaurants and a food court. That means a greater variety of places to eat in our area. 
	Having a shopping center built in the neighborhood would also mean more jobs for the community. Initially, these jobs would be in the building of the center. Later the jobs would be in the stores, theaters, and food establishments. 
	Of course, there would be some disadvantages. Probably the biggest problem would be traffic. A lot of people would be coming to the shopping center. They'd drive through our neighborhood to get to the center. In addition, if there wasn't enough parking at the center, they might look for parking spaces near our homes. 
	A shopping center might also invite more crime into our neighborhood. Parking lots after dark are a big temptation to robbers. They know people are there with money to spend. The shopping center might also become a place where unruly teenagers would gather. This could cause trouble. Our town would need a community center for them to go to instead. 
	On the whole, though, I think my neighborhood should support having a shopping center built here. It would bring more variety to our shopping, give us the opportunity to amuse ourselves at movie theaters and restaurants, and bring more jobs into the area.
