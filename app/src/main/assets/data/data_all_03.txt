Topic 51.	What does success come from? @Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. In your opinion, what does success come from? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: The question about what success comes from has been so much debated in our society. Some may think that careful planning contributes to success. Traditionally, young people turn to the successful people for guidance because young people believe that they can make excellent achievements through careful planning. Today, this view might be reversed. More and more people are taking a fresh look at it. Based on hardworking, they prefer taking risks rather than simply careful planning. 
	The most persuasive argument is that people taking risks or chances are more likely to succeed than the others. Risks or chances are not questions that people who disagree the point can shrug off lightly. With the advent of advanced international communication, a great number of opportunities you will face to by which the traditional careful planning is threatened. The difference between the two opinions is courage to challenge yourself. Actually, the only one step in the gap is not bound conquered at all, in most cases, which prevent too many cowards from succeeding at last. People being short of bravery - if they are prepared to admit it - could learn one or two from the brave ones who actually not only have courage but also are wise and confident. One of the biggest lessons they should learn is that how to plunk up your courage. 
	The resource from which courage comes is nothing more than experience. It is hardly possible to decide whether to take a risk in front of some important affairs without any experience. To gain experience, one of the most necessary approaches for you is to learn how to analyze and sum up what you have done no matter you won or lost. As an old saying goes “Failures teach success.” Confidence is the basis to your goal. Never give up solid aims in life and encourage yourself from time to time as Abraham Lincoln once said, “I will prepare and someday my chance will come.” 
	Finally, taking risks or chances can be regarded as a break with the tradition. The emphasis on the challenge has been exactly expected because that it is surely help people succeed avoiding wasting time. No other reasonable solution in intensive completion provides many opportunities to accomplish your object in life. 
	From the above what I have discussed, we can draw a conclusion that superficially, the careful planning is a sound solution, but when we weighting in mind attentively, we find that taking risks or chances is more necessary to success.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Nothing ventured. Nothing gained. If our great explorers and scientists did not live by this creed, where would we be? I think that we must all take risks in our lives, but these must be calculated risks. Like the great thinkers of our time, we must plan carefully, seize all opportunities, and reevaluate our plans. 
	There is no such thing as a chance occurrence. Columbus in his search for the Indies drew maps, plotted his route carefully, and set out. Madame Curie worked diligently in her laboratory recording every aspect of her experiments. You need to have a careful plan so you can measure your success. 
	Even with a careful plan, changes occur. Columbus was looking for the Indies, but ended up in the Caribbean. Lewis and Clark were looking for a river passage west, but discovered much more. You have to be ready to take advantage of new things as they occur. 
	When things go against plan, you must be ready to change direction. Columbus didn't bring back spices from the East Indies, he brought back gold from the West Indies. It is important to see the positive side of things. Make your mistakes work for you. 
	You will never succeed in life if you don't take chances. But before you start, you must plan carefully so you are ready to take advantage of every opportunity and turn mistakes to your advantage.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Every day, new businesses are created. Some of these businesses will succeed, but many will fall by the wayside. Some ventures may be on shaky ground at the start, but with perseverance and careful planning, they will prevail in the end. Hopefully a careful plan will not lead to a surprise but rather an expected result and success. 
	- There is a tide in the affairs of men
	- Which, taken at the flood, leads on the fortune Omitted, all the voyage of their life
	- Is bound in shadows and in miseries.
	(By Shakespeare)
	Admittedly, chance can sometimes help a man to succeed. But on the other hand, not everyone will have such luck. How can a businessman who succeeds by taking risks sustain his dealing with his business when he is suddenly out of luck? Most likely, their company will be out of business if they have not made an all-rounded plan. 
	Nevertheless, chance favors a prepared mind. The opportunity is equal to all the people. The key to success is not waiting for a chance, but seizing it. Obviously, careful planning will guide a man definitely, from which, he cannot only find a destination and prevent him from aimlessness, but also assist him to grip the chances on his way to success. For instance, an entrepreneur should understand the power of a cautious plan which may help him define his business concepts, estimate costs, predict sales, control risks, and even increase the chances of succeeding. The plan may tell him what he should do and how to do it. Going into business without a plan is just like having an expedition in the extensive ocean without a compass. 
	In the second place, a comprehensive plan is also a reliable backup. Although the original plan is followed, suffering may come for some unpredictable occasions. In that way, a well-considered plan that mentions all the possibilities can be very helpful. 
	From what has been discussed above, chances and taking risks may be unavoidable, but success results primarily from careful planning. A comprehensive schedule, similar to a guide in explorations, is a necessity for achievement.

Topic 52.	Make your hometown more appealing @What change would make your hometown more appealing to people your age? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.
Essay 1: Everything in the universe is in constant change. And everything needs continual improvement if the ever changing and increasing demands of humankind are to be met. If I am ever given the chance to change one important thing about my home town, it would be internet service. Needless to say that nothing generally revolutionized the way we live as Internet in the past decade. Thus, an improvement in this vital service would mean an even more, unheard betterment to the people in my hometown. 
	It is said that information is power. True saying indeed! I can envision how everything in my hometown could improve dramatically if the Internet service in it were made free, fast and staying out there like electricity, telephone or water all the time. One thing, a fast free and reliable Internet service could improve in my hometown is the way people work. If there are these services, people in my home town must not necessarily commute to a far place to do their job. This in turn would mean less traffic jams, spacious workplace, more time for family and recreation and so on. 
	The way people learn would be another important thing that a fast, free and reliable Internet service could better in my hometown. People will have the chance to go through tremendous and different information resources in a very small amount of time. They apparently will also take less time to share it. This assures a more fulfilled life for my hometown people. 
	Since its advent, Internet touched every part of our life. It in a dazzling way improved the way we do business, learn and communicate. A change in Internet service implies good way of living for every one in my hometown.

Topic 53.	The most important aspect of a job @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The most important aspect of a job is the money a person earns. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: The most important aspect of a job is the money a person earns. When I get a job, I want to earn a lot of money. If I earn a lot of money, people will know I am successful, smart, and a good candidate for marriage. 
	Money equals success. If I earn a lot of money, I can wear nice clothes, get a big car, buy my parents a nice apartment, and spend a lot of money on my friends. Everyone will know I am rich and very successful. 
	Earning a lot of money will show people how smart I am. Everyone knows you can't be stupid and earn a lot of money. Who will trust someone stupid to do a job? 
	When I earn a lot of money, my mother will be able to find me a good wife. She will be able to tell everyone what an important job I have. It will make it easy for her to find someone for me since all girls want to marry a rich man. 
	I don't care what kind of work I do as long as I earn a lot of money. That's the most important thing for me. Having a well-paying job will show everyone that I am successful, smart, and a good catch!

Topic 54.	Judge a person by external appearance @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? One should never judge a person by external appearances. Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.
Essay 1: What do you feel when a handsome gentleman or a beautiful lady passes by? Then how about a fat short person wearing a dirty shirt? You feel differently? Yes, most people do. It's very common for people to judge a person by external appearance, because it's easy and direct, and it's instinctive. Appearance is a very important aspect of a person and reflects one's personalities. Sometimes you can tell the person's characteristics from his appearance. However, in most cases, you can't tell exactly what the person is like just from the external appearance, and ethically, we should not judge a person just by one glance at his external appearance. 
	"Beauty and beast" and "Snow white and seven dwarves" are two stories that are almost known by everyone. Although there are fables, there are deep meanings inside them. What you can learn from them is that people that are not so good-looking can be very good people internally. And actually there are tons of examples in reality. Napoleon is a very short guy, but he was one of the most famous people in the history. Theodore Roosevelt, former US president during World War II, is handicapped; but he is one of the most successful presidents in American history. So how can you tell about the people from their external appearance? 
	Moreover, there are other undeniable facts which show that a beautiful person may be rotten inside. There are many prostitutes on the busy streets. It's obviously that they are very beautiful, but are they really righteous people? A beautiful appearance is a good thing, but a righteous heart is more valuable. Finally, as we can see, it's out of question that we should not judge people just from their external appearance. The most important standard is their internal personality.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: In most cases, one should never judge a person by external appearances. Sometimes when I walk down the street at night, I avoid people who are acting tough and loud, but in general, I prefer to reserve judgment until I get to know someone. Judging someone by external appearance can be deceptive. Judgments based on external appearances prevent you from getting to know a person, reinforce stereotypes, and are superficial and limiting. 
	In high school I stayed away from students who were called the "bad students" because they dressed a certain way. I wanted nothing to do with them. I later had the chance to meet one of these "bad students" because his mother was a friend of my mother. Since we had to be polite to each other because of our mothers, we started talking and I realized that we had a lot in common. My impression of him was very different once I got to know him. 
	If you form an opinion of someone based on stereotypes, you risk never getting to know someone who is different. You may be missing out on an opportunity to make a good friend. In addition, you are reinforcing that stereotype by believing it without given the person a chance. If you take the time to get to know the person, you might become friends. 
	Judging people by external appearance is superficial and often unfair. After all, you don't know what circumstances the person might be facing or who the person really is. Perhaps the person comes from a less fortunate family than you and cannot afford the kind of stylish clothes your friends wear. However, that does not mean the person is less intelligent or interesting than you are. 
	People should not be naïve about new people they meet, but should take time to get to know them. External appearance often does not tell us anything about a person. Judging someone by their appearance is misleading, reinforces stereotypes, and is limiting. Doing so could prevent you from making a true friend.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Some people judge a person only by his or her external appearances. I disagree with their attitude. I think that one should never judge a person by external appearances. 
	Judging a person by his or her external appearances may mislead your understanding him or her. A person who has a pretty face and wears beautiful clothes may not have same kind of heart inside. On the other hand, the internal characters of a person cannot be judged by his or her external appearances. 
	If you judge a person only by his or her external appearances, you may lose chances to make good friends. Everyone has his own habits to choose clothes, hair style and the way to live. Maybe both of you have interests and hobbies in common. You cannot know this point because your wrong judgment from his different ways to deal with something prevents you from knowing his interest and keeps you too far from him to make good friends. 
	Judging a person by external appearances is unfair and one-sided. To evaluate a person fairly, you have to know his family, his situation and him entirely and clearly. A person who is from poor family may be intelligent and diligent. The one who can afford expensive clothes may be indifferent with others. 
	So I think that judging a person by his or her external appearances always leads us to draw a wrong conclusion about a person. It is limiting and unfair. Everyone longs for the understanding from others. So we should give others chances to show all of their characters and at the same time we should evaluate them fairly and objectively.

Topic 55.	Making an important decision alone @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A person should never make an important decision alone. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: A person should never make an important decision alone. Important decisions should be well thought out. People who know you well, know what is best for you. People close to you can give you good advice, give you a different perspective, or share their own experience. 
	When I had difficulty deciding which classes to take in college, I talked to my teachers and advisors. They had the knowledge and expertise to help me determine which classes were the best ones to take for my future career. Without their advice, I might have chosen unsuitable courses. 
	In college, I had convinced myself that I was not good enough to act in the school play. Therefore, I decided not to audition even though drama had always been my passion. The day of the auditions, a friend of mine asked me why I wasn't auditioning. 
	When I told her I didn't feel I was good enough, she was shocked. She was able to provide me with another perspective on my talents and myself. I rethought my decision and tried out… and got a lead in the play. 
	Last year when I was trying to decide whether or not I should study overseas, I talked to my friend. This was the best thing I could have done. This was a big decision for me because I had never been overseas on my own and I wasn't sure I could do it. She had studied overseas the previous year. She told me about the challenges and opportunities I might encounter and helped me make the right decision. I went and it was amazing! 
	Whenever I am faced with an important decision, I seek advice from others so that I am well informed and have the benefit of their perspective and experience.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: A child can decide to buy his favourite candy, he can make a decision to get the books he is longing for, and he can also determine to make friends with other kids. However, can he make an important decision alone? For example, which school is better for him to attend? Which road of life will he go? In my opinion, a child should never make an important decision alone? There are several reasons for my point 
	First of all, he has fewer experiences than his parents. The environment he lives in is pure, in fact, the society is not as simple as he might think. While his parents know our society better, they have done much, and they have seen much, so they may think much. In another word, when they face an important decision, they will consider all kinds of factors, such as the effects and the results, while a child can never do that. 
	Second, the thought of a child might not correct. The bad programmers in the television, some articles in the magazine have negative effects on the child, they can also lead the child to a wrong way. So, as parents, they should inform the child how to tell the bad from the good. In this way, they can make sure their child will not make a wrong decision. So making a correct decision depends on the parents. 
	However, when the child is growing up, yes, when he is not a child any longer, should we let he make an important decision alone? I think it is right time for him to make an important decision alone. 
	In the first place, a person can never depend on his parents, friends forever. Everyone has his own way to go, no one can help you all the time. As the English saying goes: “God only help those who can help themselves. “So, he must learn how to make a decision. Maybe at first, he will not feel comfortable, maybe it will not correct, but I think it is benefit for his growing. 
	Second, as the important decision is made by himself alone, he can never blame on someone else, he must have responsibility for himself. And it is obvious that the decision he makes comes from his own interest, so he will do better. 
	In conclusion, when a child makes an important decision, he should listen to his parents more. But when he grows up, he should learn to make a decision alone.

Topic 56.	The arts or environment? @A company is going to give some money either to support the arts or to protect the environment. Which do you think the company should choose? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: Deciding between supporting the arts and protecting the environment is a difficult choice to make, but I think I would choose protecting the environment. Arts help to maintain our culture and serve as a source of entertainment. However, we need a healthy environment in order to survive so we must protect it. We need to protect the environment now to help prevent health problems, to maintain the ecosystem, and to preserve the Earth for our children. 
	Pollution from factories and cars can cause damage to the environment. Moreover, pollution causes health problems particularly for children and the elderly who have weaker immune systems. We need to ensure that there are controls on the amount of pollution when possible so as to prevent health problems caused by breathing dirty air. 
	We also need to pay attention to the ecosystem. Trees, plant life, and people all depend on each other. An unhealthy environment can have harmful effects on the ecosystem. For example, if a plant dies because of changes to the environment and that plant is food for an animal, that animal won't have any food. If humans use that animal as a food source, there could be big problems. 
	If we do not respect our environment now, it will continue to get worse and our children will suffer the consequences. They would not have the same quality of air to breathe or natural beauty to admire. That would be sad. 
	Without clean air to breathe, a healthy ecosystem, and a future for our children, the human race would not survive. That's why protecting our environment is important. If we have a healthy environment, we have healthy children who will be able to participate and appreciate the arts.

Topic 57.	Which type of movie do you like? @Some movies are serious, designed to make the audience think. Other movies are designed primarily to amuse and entertain. Which type of movie do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: Movies have become more and more popular in our daily life. Many people like to choose to go to a theater or watch movies on TV in their spare time. However, it seems that different people have different tastes. For example, some people like to see some serious movies; on the contrary, others may enjoy the ones just entertaining themselves. As far as I am concerned, I prefer the former ones, the kind of movies designed to make us think. 
	Firstly, serious movies can give us something to think about. Unlike amusing ones, probably there is nothing still left in our mind after a certain period of time. Comparatively, serious movies are supposed to stipulate the audience to think, acquire something valuable from the thinking and then keep it in mind for a relatively longer period of time. Such is a kind of course of learning, and what we obtain in this way maybe turn out to be a necessary supplement to what we learn from the textbooks. 
	Furthermore, the serious movies can help us gain some life experiences we might have not had in our real life before. Through imaging ourselves being in the plot, we may get to know how to make the proper reactions in different situations. Also the movies give us the opportunity to think or value whether the roles act right or not, through which we are sure to become smarter than before, which is definitely benefit to our future life. 
	For us young generation, we need to learn something new every day by different ways. In this case, thinking is incredible for us. Fortunately, serious movies play a right role in leading us to a more thinking life.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Movies have the power to make you laugh, cry, or think about an issue that you might not otherwise think about. Although 'I sometime watch movies that are serious in nature, I prefer movies that amuse and entertain. When I see an amusing movie it makes me relax, laugh, and keeps me in good spirits. 
	After a long day at school and work, I need a break and something to take my mind off of the troubles of the day. I learn do that with an entertaining movie. When I watch an amusing movie, I don't have to think. I just want to sit back and relax. After a movie, I then feel ready to get back to work on my studies. 
	Amusing movies make people laugh. Laughing is important for the soul. Laughing not only makes people feel good, but also connects people. When people laugh together, they become friends. 
	After watching an entertaining movie, which relaxes me and makes me laugh, I feel good. When I feel good I can focus more on other important things like my studies and work. Being in good spirits makes me feel better about myself and gives me a positive outlook on life. 
	While I can appreciate serious movies that make you think, I prefer to be amused and entertained after a long day of work. Such movies allow me to take a break from the rigors of life by making me laugh and putting me in a good mood.

Topic 58.	Businesses and their profit @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Businesses should do anything they can to make a profit. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.
Essay 1: After I get my degree, I plan to start a business. My goal is to make money, a lot of money. However, I can't forget that there are more important things in life than earning a profit. I must consider the people I work with, the customers I serve, and the community I live in. 
	My colleagues are a very important part of my business. Without them, I would not have a business. I depend on them to help me carry on the day-to-day operations. I depend on them for their advice on what to sell and how to sell it. I must compensate them for their work. I can't take large profits without sharing with the people who made it responsible. 
	Similarly, I would not have a business without my customers. I can never forget that they could take their business elsewhere. I must give them good value for their money. I can't overcharge them. I must also remember that money is as important to them as it is to me. I want my customers to trust me and keep coming back. 
	My employees and I all live in the same community as our customers. We are a part of the social life of our community. We can't ignore it. We must play an active part in it. I feel it is important that some of the profits my business earns from the community be returned to the community. We need to support community programs like summer jobs for high school students, campaigns to clean up the parks, and efforts to make the shopping area more attractive. 
	A business must make profits, but we all-workers, customers, community-must profit from a successful business.

Topic 59.	Living a life in a hurry or slowly? @Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: Life is short. Haste makes waste. What's your hurry? These three sayings characterize the way I manage my day to day chores. I don't want to rush through things; I prefer to take my time. 
	Life is short. You never know what may happen tomorrow so it is important to enjoy today. Of course, some people will say that's why it is important to cram a lot into a day. But then, how would you possibly have time to enjoy all of those experiences. By doing a few things slowly and doing them well, you can savor the experience. 
	Haste makes waste. We are not machines. We can't rush through things mechanically. If we do, we might forget something; we might take shortcuts. By taking our time, we can do a chore carefully, completely, and correctly. 
	What's your hurry? Where's the fire? I don t see any need to rush to the next experience. There's still a lot to see and learn from the chores around you. Taking care of your baby brother for instance can be very rewarding. You could simply keep him near you while you watch TV and write a letter and talk on the phone. Or you could devote your whole attention to him and observe his reactions to his environment. You can observe carefully, if you are trying to do four things at the same time. 
	To twist a common saying, "Don't just do something, sit there!" Take life easy and savor each minute. Life is shorter than you think.
@Notes: 
Topic 60.	Games for adults and children @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Games are as important for adults as they are for children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: The young of most mammals, including humans, like to play. Scientists claim that with lions, for example, play fighting prepares the cubs for their future life as a hunter and killer. The question is whether games and play teach humans about life. Many people believe that games accustom the player to life-skills such as perseverance and competitiveness. 
	However, I disagree with the title statement because I consider games to be mainly for children. In childhood, we do not have responsibility for the world. The child is always eager to grow up -to become a year older t or to reach the legal age of an adult. Children find happiness in games by pretending to be an adult in the real world. The problem is that games are optional; they contain too much happiness and too little hardship to ever be real. An adult, by contrast, finds meaning in his life by accepting that there are greater things in the world than his own happiness. 
	One of the dangers of games is that some people attempt to translate the rules of a game onto reality. The modern example of this problem is television and computer games. People in the West are now growing concerned that children and teenagers occasionally imitate violence which they see on the screen. 
	Death is fun on a computer game; and unstable teenagers who “zap” people in computer games can forget the value of life. American films are often accused of making violence glamorous. 
	This is not to say that games did not deceive people before the invention of television and the microchip. Success as a sports-star can lead a player to self-importance. If a football player is made captain of his team and receives praise from the local press, he might be tempted to assume that he is “the boss” in other areas of his life, such as within friendships. Also, he might be surprised to find that sport is simply not important. 
	Finally, gambling should also be mentioned as a dangerous game. Although gambling and the acceptance of luck are acceptable features of many cultures, a selfish gambler can neglect his financial duties towards his family. Eventually, gambling can become a drug which destroys life. 
	To an extent, life for most people is precarious enough to include some degree of winning and losing, and of adventure. Also, an unexpected opportunity or lucky find is one of the joys of life. But sooner or later we have to settle down and face the grind of adult life.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Many people have indulged in games and have had fun in a good game at some point in their lives. Games primarily exist to provide pleasure as a leisure activity for people of all ages. Today, it is believed that the hectic work schedule of an adult's life has prevented him from indulging in games whether indoor or outdoor. Some of the better known indoor games are board games like chess, while the more popular outdoor games include many sports like soccer, badminton, and tennis. 
	I feel that games play an essential role in the development of a healthy human being. An example of an indoor game which I think is excellent is chess. Chess is a game enjoyed by many adults today because of the challenge it presents one's mind in his "intelligence' to defeat his opponent. To many people, they feel that "exercising" the mind with the indulgence of the game promotes intelligence in an individual because the game triggers the mind to think and constantly questions his every risky move. 
	Outdoor games are at least as important in the development of a healthy body as physical activities trigger the body's metabolism to burn excess fat and calories. Studies have shown that people are not susceptible to diseases and subsequently live longer in a regular routine of daily exercise which is very often in the form of games. Popular games like tennis soccer have become many adults' favorites after a long, hard day at work. 
	In conclusion, there are many advantages in playing games for working adults. While many adults today are finding it difficult to include games in their leisure, it is important to realize the benefits that are accompanied by activities such as playing games. Playing games not only helps relieves stress accumulated from an individual's demanding work life but are also fun to indulge in. It fosters good social relations amongst friends and family members and thus a reason why games are indispensable and should be included in one's lifestyle.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Playing games has always been thought to be important to the development of well-balanced and creative children; however, what part, if any, they should play in the lives of adults has never been researched that deeply. I believe that playing games is every bit as important for adults as for children. Not only is taking time out to play games with our children and other adults valuable to building interpersonal relationships but is also a wonderful way to release built up tension. 
	There's nothing my husband enjoys more after a hard day of work than to come home and play a game of Chess with someone. This enables him to unwind from the day's activities and to discuss the highs and lows of the day in a non-threatening, kick back environment. A close friend received one of my most memorable wedding gifts, a Backgammon set. I asked him why in the world he had given us such a gift. He replied that he felt that an important aspect of marriage was for a couple to never quit playing games together. Over the years, as I have come to purchase and play, with other couples & co-workers, many games like: Monopoly, Chutes & Ladders, Mastermind, Dweebs, Geeks, & Weirdos, etc. I can reflect on the integral part they have played in our weekends and our "shut-off the T. V. and do something more stimulating" weeks. They have enriched my life and made it more interesting. Sadly, many adults forget that games even exist and have put them away in the cupboards, forgotten until the grandchildren come over. 
	All too often, adults get so caught up in working to pay the bills and keeping up with the 
	"Joneses'" that they neglect to harness the fun in life; the fun that can be the reward of enjoying a relaxing game with another person. It has been said that "man is that he might have joy" but all too often we skate through life without much of it. Playing games allows us to: relax, learn something new and stimulating, interact with people on a different more comfortable level, and to enjoy non-threatening competition. For these reasons, adults should place a higher priority on playing games in their lives.
@Notes: 
Essay 4: Nowadays, there are more and more games for us to play, and people are playing game more than before. We can play alone or with others. The question is whether playing game is important for adults. Some think that it is a waste of time, while others regard it as important part of our life. 
	I think that playing game is one important part of our life because it relaxes me from long time work and adds more knowledge, even play group game can enhance the personal relationship. 
	After long time work, people will get tired and need some relax. Game is one of the pleasant way to do so. For example, playing table tennis after work will not only relax you but also good for health. Secondly, people can learn some knowledge while play games. Word game can build up vocabulary, play chess can train people to think more clever. 
	Another reason that game is important is that it can build up a good relationship between people. Persons with the same interest in certain game will get other more often. The friendship will be strengthened and then they can learn from each other more things. 
	Even though I think the game is important, I do not mean that it can be play without limits. Excessive indulge in the game will waste time and do not good to the health. But this cannot be regarded as the reason to prevent game playing.
@Notes: 
Essay 5: I agree with the statement "Playing games is important for adults". In this challenging world, adults work very hard to earn a better living and thus don't get time to keep their body and mind fit. By playing games, adults can not only remain fit but can enjoy life too. 
	Games can be of two types: physical and mental. The former keeps the body fit whereas, the latter keeps the mind fit. The following are the reasons to support my answer. 
	Physical games include indoor games like table tennis and outdoor games like football and basketball. These games not only increases blood circulation but also burns the excess fat present in our body that keeps us fresh and thus improves our working habits. These games also teach discipline, co-operation, and respect for others, builds self-confidence and teaches us to face defeat bravely, which in turn helps us face failures in life too. 
	Mental games include chess, puzzle, quiz and IQ. These games increase our mental ability and thinking power. These games teaches to make decisions, increases our knowledge, improves our way of thinking and the ability to remember things, and thus keeps us mentally alert and allows to take the right decision in life. 
	By looking at the above reasons, I conclude that games whether they are physical or mental, indoor or outdoor not only improves our lifestyle but also helps us achieve our goals in life. 
	Therefore, playing games is important for adults.
@Notes: 
Essay 6: I do strongly support the idea that playing games is important for adults. It is useful and fun, too. It is one of the most important ways to cope with the problems of business and daily life. There are several benefits of playing games for adults. First, playing games creates leisure time that every adult must have to lessen the stress of business life. It’s another benefit is that It can improve reflex, intelligence or health depending on the kind of the game ,and it also gives pleasure to the adults as well as children. 
	As we know today business life is a place full of stress. People generally come to their homes being tired and irritated. Therefore, every individual adult must create leisure times to forget the daily life's problems and to feel relieved. So, playing some kinds of games can help them to have free, without stress, times and to relax. Parents also, by this way, can make a better communication with their children by playing some games such as backgammon, chess, puzzles or computer games. Children gain self-confidence due to this relationship with their parents, too. It certainly is a notable point of playing games referring to a family life. Consequently, playing games alone or with their families gives support adults to preserve their health, to lessen their stresses and to deal with business problems. 
	With the development of technology, people, both adults and children, began to give more and more importance to computer based games. The computer based technology actually made games more interesting and more complicated than were they before. Because of their visual and sophisticated subjects, the computer based games can easily contribute to maintain an adult's reflex and intelligence thanks to their interactive skills. Moreover, brain gymnastics with these games are beneficial for adults to solve their personal problems. For example, some business men or consultants achieve much success or make better decisions after playing some computer games when tried of working. This means that computers seem to remove the idea that games are merely for kids. 
	Enjoyment is another factor that should be considerate while thinking of the relation between adults and games. It is certain to believe that many adults get very much pleasure from games. They gain the amusement of their previous childhood again and again while playing games with the child living in their spirits. So, if a director of a company or a president of a country is seen while he or she is playing a computer game or playing football with some kids, it should not be peculiar. Obviously, they will spend more happier time than any child will and forget every types of problems that they have during the game. Last but not least I wish to say that playing games is important for adults as well as all human beings. It is useful, necessary, enjoyable and educational. Since life, itself, is a game in which the players are we, it is unavoidable to spend time without playing games at any age.
@Notes: 
Essay 7: Some people assert that playing games is important for adults. In my opinion the importance of playing games depends on the types of games considered. While some games may benefit to health, mental abilities, working capacity, or help to relax, others may harm the person playing in different ways. I think the games that are important for adults to play include those requiring action, intensive thinking and team work. It has been medically proven that physical training is extremely important for adults. It helps not only to maintain fitness, but also enhances the capacity of thinking and working. Therefore participating in sports games, such as basketball, football, tennis and other action games is essential. Games that require intensive thinking develop logic, attention and unconventional approach. Among this type of games are puzzles, crosswords, and strategy games. And last, but not least, games that involve team work are important to develop further communicability, ability to make correct decisions with consideration of opinions of different people and other skills, because these skills are often used in everyday situations. 
	Still there are other types of games that may be harmful. These are majorly computer games, which cause severe eye-strain and exposure to radiation. Moreover, computer games not only harm health, but also have a negative impact on the working capacity. Many companies have stringent rules against their employees playing games during work-hours. 
	There is also one category of games which I believe can be both harmful and beneficial. These are games played for money. On one hand, winning such a game the player feels positive emotions, which have an overall positive influence on the player’s health and financial situation. On the other hand, losing the game can drive the person playing into disappointment and even into depression, thus harming his health, not to mention the loss of money. 
	Thus, in my opinion, the importance of adults playing games can be evaluated depending on the level of positive or negative influences that those game may have on the person involved.

Topic 61.	Making decisions for teenage? @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older (15 to 18 year-old) teenage children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.
Essay 1: No one knows me as well as my parents. No one wants the best for me like my parents. It is natural that I should allow my parents to make important decisions for me. I think all older teenagers (15 to 18 year-olds) should take their parents advice on decisions that concern their education, their social life, and their future careers. 
	My parents have always chosen the best schools for me to attend. They have encouraged me to attend special prep classes to make sure that I was well prepared for the exams. They have given me tutors to make sure that I understood my subjects well. When it comes to choosing a college, I will trust my parents to make that decision. They know what they can afford and what will give me a good education. 
	When I was young, my parents would invite children over to play with me. Over the years, I have become very close to these children. They are like my family. We celebrate holidays and birthdays together. We even go to the mountains together in the summer. My parents do not want me to fall into the wrong crowd. They do not want me to meet and fall in love with someone they do not know. I understand that and I want to make them happy. 
	My father runs a very successful business and my mother is a well-known politician. They are very well connected and they have many friends who would like me to work for them when I finish school. This is a very good arrangement for me. 
	If all children follow their parents’ wishes, they would probably be happier. Parents only want the best for their children.

Topic 62.	Characteristics in a friend @What do you want most in a friend - someone who is intelligent, or someone who has a sense of humor, or someone who is reliable? Which one of these characteristics is most important to you? Use reasons and specific examples to explain your choice.
Essay 1: Friends are very important in everyone's life. But there are different types of friends: some of them are very intelligent, some have a good sense of humour and some are reliable. What I want most is the friend who has a good sense of humour. 
	Humour is a very important character of a person, because a person who is humorous can always bring you happiness. I have a friend, who is not very intelligent and reliable, but he is one of my best friends, just because he has a good sense of humour. Whenever you call him, talk with him, he always tells you some funny jokes that make you laughing. Even though you are in a very bad mood, he can make you laugh and forget the sad things. A friend with a good sense of humour is very optimistic; they can make your world full of light. 
	If a person doesn't have a sense of humor at all, that's really bad. No matter how intelligent he is, no matter how reliable he is, he will never bring you happiness, although he can help you solve a few problems, his world is without laughter. In my class there is a very smart guy, but because of his lack of humor, we don't like to play with him, although it seems that he knows everything. 
	Friend plays a very significant role in everyone's life. But humor is the most important character in a friend, because humorous friends make you happy and see the world optimistically. They make your world full of hope, and full of laughter.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: I think what I want most in a friend is someone who is reliable. There is two reasons: first, I think a reliable person can be trusted, then, I think whenever I have trouble, I can rely on him, he will be sure to help me a lot. 
	First of all, as a friend of mine, he must be reliable, so that I can trust him. I think friends are the ones who share secrets with me. I must make sure that he is reliable, then I can tell my even the deepest secret in my heart, may be the skeleton in the cupboard. Well, I’m just kidding, but I do think that being reliable is the most important factor of a friend. Imagine that once you told your secrets to your friend, and you found in the following day that everybody in the school was talking about your secret - not a secret any more - how would you feel? It’s such a horrible thing, isn’t it? Besides your huge anger, the only thing you could do is to regret that you didn’t choose a reliable friend. Now you can see how important choosing a reliable friend is. 
	Secondly, a reliable friend is always ready to help you whenever you are in trouble. There is an old saying that "a friend in need is a friend indeed" which is very meaningful. That is what a reliable friend does. You can always rely on him. We can say that a reliable friend is a true friend. One is lucky if he has even one reliable friend in his life. Not too many words are needed for a reliable friend to help you, just one sentence "thank you, my friend" is enough and you needn’t think hard in the pay back because that is not necessary. That’s the reason why I see reliability as the most important factor when I choose my friends. 
	A reliable person can be trusted and relied on - that’s the two reasons why I think reliability is what I want most in a friend.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: The answer of this statement depends on your own experience and life style. In my point view, the most important quality for a friend is reliable. Among countless factors which influence the choice, these are three conspicuous aspects as follows. 
	To me, reliability is the most important quality of a friend. A friend is person whom we know, like, and trust. We may know and like a person who is intelligent, or who has a sense of humor, but we cannot can him a friend unless he is also faithful and trustworthy. Perhaps we all know the famous novel by Victor Hugo, Notre-Dame de Paris, and wish that we had a friend like Quasimodo. Although he is ugly, the man has a kind heart and a very loyal nature. He seems dedicated to anyone who will show him in turn kindness. Even if someone we know who does not have a sense of humor, or does not intelligent enough, he can still be our friend because he is the one we can trust. 
	Another reason can be seen by every person is that a friend must a person whom we can depend on. He is willing to listen to us, give us supports, and sympathizes with us when we are in need. “A friend in need is a friend indeed.” A friend is a person whom we can trust our feelings and inner thoughts with, and do not fear that he will betray us. It is hard to imagine that anyone will share his thoughts with a person who, afterwards will spread the content of their conversation to everyone else in the world. 
	Of course, intelligent and humorous are also important qualities of a friend. A friend who is mentally acute can give us sound judgment and rationality when we have problems; a friend who is funny can give us an enjoyable time, and add spice to our life. But for me, I still think that the most important quality of a friend is being reliable.
@Notes: 
Essay 4: Friendship is a very important part in everyone's life. There are different kinds of friends: some of them are intelligent, some have a good sense of humor and some are reliable. What I want most is the friend who has a good sense of humor. 
	Humor is a very important character for a person, because a person who is humorous can always bring us happiness. I have a friend, who is not very intelligent, but he is one of my best friends, simply because he has a good sense of humor. Whenever I call him, talk with him, he always tells me some funny jokes that make me laughing. Even though I am in a very bad mood, he can make me laugh and forget about the sad things. In addition, a person with a good sense of humor is very optimistic; they can make our world full of light. 
	But if a person doesn't have a sense of humor at all, that's really bad. No matter how intelligent he is, no matter how reliable he is, he will never bring us happiness, although he can help us to solve a few problems, but his world is without laughter. In my class there is a very smart guy, but because of his lack of humor, we don't like to play with him, although it seems that he knows everything. 
	Friends are very important in everyone's life, and humor is the most important characteristic in a friend, because humorous friends make us happy. They make our life full of joy, and full of laughter.
@Notes: 
Essay 5: Almost every person in the world needs friends. Different people hold different opinions in choosing friends. Some consider intelligence as the most important characteristics in their friends; others regard a sense of humor as the most significant personality. As far as I am concerned, reliability, which means faith, confidence and trust, is of vital importance. The reasons go as follows. 
	Firstly, based on reliability, friendship can be lasting. On the one hand, when your friends are faithful, you would love to get in close touch with them. For instance, you could reveal your secrets to them without worry about being betrayed, and tell them your pleasure so as to double the joys. On the other hand, when you are loyal to your friends, they would also like to keep relationship between each other. Undoubtedly, you will be frequently invited to friends’ get-togethers and discussions, in which your opinions will be fully taken into consideration since your friends respect you and know your suggestion does good not only to yourself but also to them as well. Thus, willing of both your friends and you to continue the formed friendship will lead to your perpetual friendship. 
	What’s more, reliability makes real friendship more solid and deeper. Take borrowing money as example, it is almost completely sure that, probably besides your family, people you ask for money are your most reliable friends. You turn to them because you trust their sincerity to give you help, and, at the same time, they exert themselves to meet your need because they are confident of your attitude to your friendship, to be more specific, your promise to return money. Friendship between those friends and you, thereby, gets further development and finally becomes really invaluable friendship just in coincide with the old saying- a friend in need is a friend indeed. 
	In conclusion, reliability can be a norm to exam the real friendship and motivate people to deepen their friendship. When I choose my friends, reliability is the foremost factor to be considered. Not only should my friends be reliable to our friendship, but also I should too.

Topic 63.	Value of difficult experiences @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support our answer.
Essay 1: Some people assume that most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time will become valuable lessons for the future. I agree with it. In my opinion, most difficult experiences we go through now will help develop our personalities, such as persistence, independence and confidence, which are most valuable for our future. 
	Persistence is the first lesson most difficult experiences will teach us. When I was a little girl, teachers and parents always taught me that if you want to succeed in our future, then you must learn how to keep ourselves persisting on our goals. From that time, I know no matter what kind of dreams I hold, I must persist in realizing them. For me, entering a university is a very good example. During my high school, I felt math was the most difficult subject for me. I almost gave up my dreams because of my poor math scores. However my mom asked me not to give up my plan and encourage me to keep going on. Finally I succeeded in entering a prestigious university. 
	After entering the university, I learned my second lesson - independence. It was a really difficult time for me because I was never far away from my parents for such a long time, what's more, I need to take care of myself not only about living conditions but also about my study. At the first period I really didn't know how to adapt myself into the new environment, it was no surprise that I got lost during that time. Luckily, I have my parents and friends' encouragement to help me go through that quite difficult time. Now I am working in Singapore and I think what makes me get used to this fast society is due to my college's experiences. I believe that I will become more independent than before. 
	Building enough confidence is another lesson the difficult experiences teaches me. Not everyone is born to be confident. What helps me build my confidence is also through most failures I went through. There is an old saying “failure is the mother of success". Yes, it is true! Through failures we can learn what we are short of and gain a lot of lessons from others. Building confidence is a gradual process. It takes time and you may see our improvement a few years later. I think the chance of getting this job greatly relies on myself to show much confidence that I can do this job well. 
	There is no denying that three important personalities I learned from most difficult experiences before make my life totally different now. In a short, we need to go through many experiences no matter they are sweet or bitter. Although most experiences are currently difficult or a bit tough for us, it is believed that this kind of influence is powerful and definitely will be valuable for our future.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Some people argue that most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time, can later become valuable experiences. I cannot agree with them more. There are numerous reasons why I hold confidence on this opinion, and I would explore only a few primary ones here. 
	Difficulties are beneficial to our personal growth. In the course of our life, we are going to face numerous difficulties and obstacles, and each difficulty will help us grow up, and become a valuable lesson for the future. A toddler fells off the ground for many times before he knows how to walk, and a child learns how to swim after he drinks water in the swimming pool. In addition, only after we experienced failures, we know the value of success. We will never appreciate anything that comes so easy. Difficulties can make us feel stronger and be more confident for the future obstacles. 
	Furthermore, difficulties in our work can help us gain more experience and knowledge. Most of the times we can gain knowledge and experiences faster through experiencing difficulties in our life and trying to find a solutions to the perplexities that we face. There is a famous saying, no pain, no gain. For example, when we take on a new job that we do not have much experience in, the first few weeks can be extremely painful and we may feel enormous pressure and difficulties. And we will try our best to adjust, to learn and to think, how to do this job better. The more difficulties we feel, the harder we try to acquire the skills and knowledge to overcome it. Learning and this stage is extremely efficient and our problem-solving skills well increase. After we overcome more and more problems, we can become an experienced worker in this field and will be able to take on more challenges. We will never fear that we will face the same kind of problem again. This means that we have accumulated valuable experiences for the future. 
	In a word, a difficult experience is a gift that life gives us. We should appreciate it and take it as a precious opportunity to gain knowledge and experience about our study, work and life.

Topic 64.	Who would you work for? @Some people prefer to work for themselves or own a business. Others prefer to work for an employer. Would you rather be self-employed, work for someone else, or own a business? Use specific reasons to explain your choice.
Essay 1: There are many advantages for people to work for themselves and have their own business. For example, you don't need to worry about getting up too late for work; you don't need to worry about the relationship between you and your boss; you may go to work at any time you want, because you are the boss of your own business. You may lead a more spontaneous and free-style life. In spite of this, personally, I would like to work for someone else. 
	No matter what kind of business you own, a domestic or international company, or a small one like a snack shop, you have to take care of many things such as a license, rent, your personnel, your competitors, product-market, even the weather if you own an umbrella shop. 
	That is what I don't like. I don't like a complicated life. I mean, I am just a normal female who hasn't much ambition either in my life or in my career. I am used to having a simple life, a regular life with discipline, without much risk. What is most important for me, besides work, is that I can still have free time the things I enjoy doing, and don't need to think about the business all the time. For me, being a business owner might have too much risk and stress. 
	Of course, being an employee, you are subject to discipline, and pay attention to your boss, but that's a part of life, just like for others, paying attention to their own business, earning a lot of money, and having risk are parts of their lives. 
	In a phrase, I would rather to work for someone else. I just want to have my own simple and regular life!
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Some people prefer to work for themselves or own a business. Others prefer to work for an employer. Personally, I prefer to work for myself. I choose to be self-employed because of the reasons as follows. 
	I can decide what I do according my own willing and interest. This point is the most important because one person can find work motility from his interest. I also can decide how to do the thing. I can choose my own directions and ways, whereas those who are employed by others must do work according to the directions of their employers. 
	The other important point is that I have freedom to decide when I do the thing. The time I work is determined by myself. I am not constricted by other people. Hence, if I am tired, I can rest in the daytime; if I have more energy, I can work late at night. I have more freedom on the choice of work time than those who work for an employer. 
	I work for myself, so I only can depend on myself. This can train me to learn more knowledge and to work hard and teach me to face the success and the failure correctly. I can learn how to take advantage of different conditions and deal with different situations from the practice. I can learn to encourage myself when I succeed and not to be afraid of difficulties and failures. 
	Based on the above statements, I think that self-employing has more advantages. So I prefer to be self-employed.
@Notes: 
Topic 65.	Preserve or destroy old buildings? @Should a city try to preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.
Essay 1: Whether the city should try to preserve its old, historic building or destroy them? I believe that different people will have different opinions. According to my experiences, I think that we should preserve these old, historic building. I like to use following reasons to explain why I think so. 
	The first and important reason is that every old building represents an important piece of history. 
	Undoubtedly, they can reflect contemporary culture, custom and life style, etc. For example, the Former Imperial Palace in China, where ancient emperors have ever stayed, has had a longstanding history as long as over 2,000 years. Through it, we cannot only remember many famous historical events, but can also know that ancient people have grasped very advanced architecture techniques and methods. 
	I believe if we demolish these valuable buildings, we will destroy a significant piece of history also. More seriously, we won’t be able to rebuild them. What people need isn’t the duplication or copy. In many old cities, there are some old houses at where there were many important meetings hold. When we visited old meeting sites, we seemed to back to that turbulent or excited time. As if we can hear again what those important historic characters were talked about each other vigorously. 
	Moving on to wider themes, I admit that some old buildings have got a bit dilapidated and unsightly, and haven’t generated any revenue for us anymore. But if we can refurbish them, I believe that they could start to attract visitors to cities again. 
	From what has been discussed above, I can safely draw the conclusion that we should preserver these old and historic buildings.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: It is a controversial problem that whether a city should preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings. Some people think that a city should preserve its old, historic buildings because they are the witness of the past, others think that a city should destroy them and replace them with modern buildings because they take up a lot of places. As far as I am concerned, I prefer the previous idea that the old, historic buildings should be preserved. 
	Although the old, historic buildings would take up a lot of places and the modern society will need these places to building the new buildings such as skyscrapers, the old, historic buildings are the witness of the history. It is known that a modern city comes from the past history which had a valuable experience. The old, historic buildings could tell people what happened in the past and what the past like was. From that, people could gain knowledge and experience to contribute to the modern society better. 
	The old, historic buildings could also be offered to education. They can become the teaching bases for children. It is necessary for children to know the past, so that they can know better about the present society. In addition, children will be interested in the strange structure of the buildings and the funny things in the buildings, which will promote the children to study. 
	Finally, the preserved building would offer the important clues for archeologists to study the past. It is more valuable to maintain them well than destroy them to build new ones. 
	In conclusion, the old, historic buildings should be preserved for the reasons above. First is that they are the witness of the past, then they could teach children something and last they are the important clues for archeologists.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: The issue here is whether old, historic buildings in a city should be preserved or replaced by modern buildings. In my opinion, buildings of historical value should definitely be protected rather than destroyed. I base my point of view on following reasons. 
	Firstly, each historical building is precious property of human being. Like an antic, the value of an old building cannot be measured by money. We will lose those valuable historical buildings permanently if we don't preserve them. Once a historical building is destroyed, we can never restore it; even if it is restored to its original look, the new building is only a fake replica; the historical value will never come back to us. 
	Secondly, a historic building always represents history and has educational functions. Each one of them can tell us a story. For example, some buildings are evidences of foreign invasion, others are signs of various religions existed in past decades. People nowadays can always obtain historic or cultural information through visiting these old buildings and sites. Although we can learn the past from books, pictures and by visiting museums, nothing can compare with the actual historical buildings themselves, which can bring vivid educational material to us. 
	Thirdly, historical buildings are a symbol of a city and a valuable tourist resource; therefore a city cannot go without historical buildings. Beijing is represented by the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace, which are all historical relics. It is hard to imagine that someday the City of Beijing decides that all these buildings should be destroyed and modern buildings be built on their sites. Because those historical relics and buildings are too important to the city and can generate profound tourist income. A city will benefit more by protecting its historic buildings than by replacing them with modern buildings. 
	For all reasons given above, I will strongly suggest a city municipal should preserve the old, historic buildings.
@Notes: 
Topic 66.	Parents and classmates @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: I strongly agree that classmates are more influential to a child's success in school than parents. This I support with the following reasons. 
	A child spends so much time with his classmates in school. They study together, play together, and write exams together. Psychologists agree that during their first years in school, children are more influenced by their companies during their emotional and mental growth. As a result, classmates are whom a kid contact most in school and will therefore have much impact on his achievements in school. 
	In addition, a child has nothing to hide with his classmates in terms of academic performance. For instance, a child who does a bad job in math exam will be revealed on his grades; a child who wins the first prize in oral debate contest will be rewarded before the whole group of students. So his classmates know both his good and bad sides of his performance in school. However, a child will conceal something to his parents while describing his conduct in school - often limit in those good points. From this, we can easily conclude that only those who understand more about a child can exert more influence on him. 
	Finally, classmates are of similar age with a child. They share so much interest in common. So a child is more sentimentally attracted by his classmates’ activities. If he is in a group of children who are interested in innovations, he will more likely to think of inventing something all day. So classmates are very helpful in his success in school. 
	From the above discussed, I agree that classmates will influence a child more in his school success because they have more time together, they understand him better than his parents, and they have so much common interest together.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Although students stay with their classmates all time in school, parents are a more important influence on a child’s success. I disagree with the statement that classmates are a more important influence on a child’s success in school, because of the reasons as follows. 
	First of all, parents are the people who understand their own children best. They know the children’s good sides and bad habits. They can correct the children’s bad idea and make them give rid of the bad habits. So children can found a good base to get success in school. But classmates cannot do these work. 
	The other reason is that parents have experiences on a lot of matters. If children have problems, parents can give them their experiences to help them solve problems. If parents have no similar experiences, they still can give their children some advice and make them avoid the wrong directions. Classmates can also give children some help, but they do not have more experiences than parents. So their influence is less than that of parents. 
	Parents also have other important influence on their children’s success in school. Parents may analyze something in different ways and have different opinions from children. Classmates also can have different opinions on one thing, but they are at the same conditions with each other, their opinions may be similar or narrow. Children can learn more comprehensive knowledge about one thing from their parents. 
	So, based on the above discussion, I think it is clear that parents are a more important influence than classmates on a child’s success in school.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: According to my experience, I fully agree the view that classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child’s success in school. I like to use following reasons to explain why I think do. 
	The first and most important reason is children can easily share their thoughts with peers. Undoubtedly, children can readily exchange their ideas at the front of classmates. I clearly remember that I like to confide my troubles to my little friends when I found that my parents could not utterly understand my thoughts. Sometimes when I could not get a better score, with which only my parents were not satisfied, my friends could give my understanding and comfort. Their words of comfort let me refresh to continue to study hard. 
	Another equally important reason is that the communication with classmates frequently is good for the cultivation of our characteristic. When we often contact with our classmates or friends, we can find our own advantages and drawbacks that I may be not conscious of at the front of our parents. Classmates can frankly point out our shortages and these helps will play an important role in our future life. 
	Moving on to the wider theme, young active and vigorous virtues will drive us more likely to stay with our classmates. After all, we have more topics with our friends. We can freely talk about our dreams, our idols, even our secrets, which only belong to our own. 
	Of course, I admit that parents can also give us many help. For example, they can teach us how to analyze positive and negative sides of everything. When we encounter heavy difficulties, parents can give us immediate help. But if all factors are contemplated, the advantages of classmates carry more weight than those of parents. 
	From what has been discussed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child’s success in school.

Topic 67.	Which kind of worker would you hire? @If you were an employer, which kind of worker would you prefer to hire: an inexperienced worker at a lower salary or an experienced worker at a higher salary? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.
Essay 1: According to my experience, I prefer to hire an experienced worker at a higher salary. I like to use following reasons to explain why I think so. 
	The first and important reason is that experienced workers themselves mean higher efficiency. I remember the words say, “Time is money”. An experienced worker just can meet this demand. Such as, many factories now adopt the system that worker’s salary will depend on the number of their qualified products. In such case, although some experienced workers can get very high salaries, considered the potential profit made by those products, I prefer to employ those experienced workers. 
	Another equally important reason is that experienced workers mean less accident at the workshop. Now people’s insurance consciousness becomes stronger and stronger. If the accidents happened, the employer will pay enormous compensation fee for injured workers. As for the apprentice, the accidents are very easily caused and almost inevitable only because he/she has no enough work experiences. In effect, the factory or company can fully avoid these accidents and unnecessary financial loss through hiring experienced employees. 
	Moving on to the wider theme, experienced workers are also the pledge of factories and companies’ ability. Now people have gradually realized that experienced worker, that is so-called talents, will be the most important factor for the enterprise’s future prosperity. Such as, many famous companies prefer to provide more attractive welfare than other companies in order to get their ideal talents, and then keep themselves long stable development. 
	Of course, as far as saving enterprise’s expense is concerned, a lower salary may be a better appeal for some companies or factories. But if all the factors are contemplated, the advantages of experienced workers carry more weight than those of inexperienced workers. 
	There are many other reasons that should be considered, but all in all, I rather hire an experienced employee at a higher salary than employ an inexperienced worker at a lower salary.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: When it comes to whether an employer should hire workers with less experiences and lower pay, or to hire experienced workers with a higher salary, since there are always advantages and disadvantages of the two, and there are always different situations, my personal option is that different strategy should be applied for different situations. 
	For situations where basic and simple jobs which requires less training, and cutting down the cost is important for the survival of the business, I would prefer to hire someone who has less experience, and willing to work under a lower pay. For example, a factory should hire more inexperienced laborers to work on the part of the plant where less skill but more physical strength is needed; and a restaurant owner should hire a cheaper kitchen hand rather than more chefs to cut down the cost of operation. 
	On the other hand, for situations when more knowledge and skills is crucial for a job, I would tend to hire someone who is more experienced and would rather pay more salary. Training an inexperienced person for an advanced position can cost a great deal of money, and a mistake an inexperienced makes sometimes can bring disaster to a company. Therefore an experienced personnel is a valuable asset for a business. Sometimes the value cannot be measured by money. A company may lost millions of dollars of revenue when some important positions are vacant and it has to look for someone who is qualified or take a lot of time to train a new person. 
	In conclusion, when we decide whether to hire an inexperienced, cheaper worker or an experienced, but more expensive worker, it is always depend on the nature of the business and the position, the amount of training required, and of course, the employers’ personal preferences.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: If I were an employer, I would be glad to hire an inexperienced worker at a lower salary. My reasons are as follows: 
	First, those who can accept the lower salary are those not care too much about money, what they care the most is personal development. The success and failure of a company are correlated to employees' attitude, a success company needs some men with the heart that eager to success. 
	Second, inexperienced men are always modest and friendly, they like to learn and listen to others opinion or suggestion, so they can improve their working skills by accept some right opinions. These are two important characteristics of a good employee, not only they can bring success business to the company but also can set up a good company impression to the public. 
	Third, those inexperienced employees are mostly just graduated from school. They are active and enthusiastic, to some extent, they prefer working together as a team to working alone. Teamwork can speed up the working efficiency and also make the company fill with energy. 
	Since there are so many advantages, why not hire inexperienced guys!
@Notes: 
Essay 4: Some employers prefer to hire people who have work experiences and pay them higher salaries. They may think that if they want to make a success in business, they have to do so. If I were an employer, however, I would rather hire the inexperienced employees and paid them a relatively lower salaries. I do not care about whether experiences an employee has or not, I really care about the cost. Besides, it needs not only experiences to do a job well and experienced workers may not definitely be suitable to certain job position. 
	Hiring an experienced employee to do a job that he has experienced means that he can easily make the job done or do it efficiently. But here is the problem. I am a poor boss. As a young man, I have not earned much money myself. The experienced worker always asks too high salary to afford at my present financial condition. If I managed to pay employees higher salaries, it would probably push me to close my business eventually. So, I need to hire the inexperienced workers with lower salaries to cut down the cost of my business. 
	To run business well, I have to consider a lot of other factors of an employee, not only the employee’s experience. Is the employee loyal to me? Could he probably cheat me in business operation? I really concern with these questions. If he chose to be not loyal to me or chose to cheat me at work, the experiences he has would be useless for my business. Considering of this, I would rather hire a worker who is inexperienced but loyal to me and trustworthy. 
	An employee who has a lot of experiences does not always mean that he is just suitable to an assigned job. Someone who has experiences does not mean that he has experienced just this present job. His experiences are simply related with his former jobs. Everything can be changed over time and the needs for the same job can be changed, too. So, if I hired an experienced worker, perhaps I would still have to train him for just the present job again. Thus, if I have to train an experienced employee and pay him higher salary, why not train an inexperienced employee and pay him lower salary, now that I have to train any employee anyway? The cost of training is just the same, but the salaries I have to pay later are different: the former is higher; the latter, lower. Anyone who has normal sense will definitely choose the latter: the inexperienced but cheaper employee. 
	In short, taking the cost, the suitability and the loyalty and honesty of employees into consideration, if I were an employer, I would definitely hire the inexperienced employees and pay them lower salaries.

Topic 68.	Homework for students @Many teachers assign homework to students every day. Do you think that daily homework is necessary for students? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.
Essay 1: There's much controversy about the necessity of daily homework for students. Some say homework is necessary since only practice makes perfect, while others disagree because they believe a student should have the freedom to study whatever in whatever forms just as he/she likes to. 
	In my opinion, daily homework is necessary for students. First, a teacher could assign homework as a guide for the students to study. To learn something. A student needs help of a teacher because he/she does not have an overall understanding of the knowledge he is going to study as the teacher. This means, at the beginning, a student could not well plan his/her study, just as a kid who is for the first time in a swimming pool could do nothing but play with water. And a teacher could make a good study plan for him/her, so that he/she could learn efficiently. Secondly, Sometimes, even when a student, especially a young one, has already understand what he/she should do in order to master some skill or knowledge, he/she is still unwilling to do this for the lack of motivation. Hey, don't tell me that you have never been lazy at all when you were young. Some homework could function as a task for the student to perform which is helpful to motivate him/her. Thirdly, homework is an important form of feedback for a teacher to understand the effectivity of his/her work. As I have mentioned before, a teacher makes a study plan for the students; but does it really work? Or does it work for all the students? It's not difficult to know this only if the teacher pay some attention to the homework of the students. Then he/she may be able to find if there's some problems in his/her teaching, and make corresponding adjustment of his/her teaching, either for all the students or for a single one. Without some feedback, it is impossible for the teacher to do this. A test is also a good form of feedback, but obviously one or two tests are not enough, and sometimes this kind of feedback just comes too late. 
	However, this conclusion might be misleading that one may believe all forms of homework are necessary. Actually, only proper amount of homework in proper forms is acceptable; some homework may not only fail to help the students, but on contrary bore them, so much so that they may lose their innate interest to study. "Proper" homework, in my opinion, should vary in its forms; it might be some extensive reading, a paper, or even just a game, as well as other ordinary exercises. And it should leave enough freedom to the students so that they could do things they really like to do with self-motivation, rather than unwillingness. We should always remember that homework is something for us to guide the students, rather than drive them. Only if a teacher keep this in his/her mind, the homework could be of most help to the students.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: "You must finish your assignment when coming back from school, “my mother always told me when I was a child. Therefore, I am used to doing my homework as my first thing at home. 
	According to my habits and fondness I am unanimous with this statement that teacher assign homework everyday. Maybe others hate doing homework everyday because they take it as a burden which will reduce their time for playing games. Here! Let me tell you why I advocate it. 
	The main reason is that teachers assigning homework everyday really helps me go over my lessons I have had on class. Through my homework I can understand the knowledge by myself and get what the teacher said the most important things in order in my brain. I really liked playing and postponed homework to the next day. Woo! That realize an old saying "Bite more than you can chew”. 
	Another reason is that completing homework everyday will help to raise habit that everyone need think in his/her own way independently. What teacher teaches us is just their understanding track and what we gain on class is just others' experience. 
	What I discussed above is just two points of many persuasive ones. To some extent, we may obey the rule - "Always work and study makes Jack a dull boy". 
	But if all these factors are contemplated the advantage of assigning homework everyday carry more weight than those of the opposite one. What I agree with is just personal idea. Maybe you can remember this word. “Going over what you've learned will give you more new knowledge."
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Many teachers assign homework to students everyday, and they seldom doubt it. However, as far as I am concerned, it is not necessary. 
	To begin with, not every teacher has classes everyday. For instance, a chemistry teacher may have no class on Monday. It makes students learn nothing new about chemistry that day. As a result, it becomes unnecessary for the chemistry teacher to assign homework. Because if the teacher still assigns homework, perhaps the students will not have enough time to review what they have learned that day, such as physics and biology. 
	In addition, everyone must have his or her own leisure time. Students are not machines. They cannot work without any rest. Even if a machine works everyday, its efficiency will become lower and lower and refuse to work finally. So the teachers must let students have some spare time, when they can play games, have a picnic and do other things they like. It is good to children’s health. 
	Last but not least, assigning homework everyday is not a scientific way of studying. Suppose you must do physics homework everyday. After several weeks, you will probably think physics is so boring that it no longer interests you. How could one learn physics well under such circumstance? I think the only way to solve this problem is not to assign physics homework everyday. 
	So from what has been discussed, one can reach only this conclusion that daily homework is not necessary at all.
@Notes: 
Essay 4: Most students in this world struggle daily with their homework. Many teachers believe that daily homework is the key to education and school success. I agree with this opinion. Here are my reasons. 
	First, daily homework can reinforce the knowledge students learned at school. A student cannot concentrate every minute, and remember everything that a teacher taught in class. Daily homework is the best way for students to review what he learned during the day, and study on the problems that he do not understand, and prepare for the next day’s work. 
	Second, daily homework is the bases of succeed in exams. This is especially true for those students who are not so bright, and the only way to succeed in school is doing homework each day. Whenever the homework flags the class behavior dips, the social behavior is muddled, and the grades take a nosedive. No matter what the ability of a student, daily homework is the key to students’ school success. 
	Third, daily homework can help students develop good learning habits. Learning is not always an enjoyable experience and students always need to spend hard time on it. Daily homework can form a kind of habit of learning for students. Once a habit is formed, learning is not such a painful thing and a student can find it more and more interesting. Obviously this will greatly benefit to a student. 
	In conclusion, daily homework is crucial to students’ success. Life requires us to keep learning in order to catch on with this fast pacing society. A good learning habit and method that we developed when we are students can benefit us for the rest of our life.
@Notes: 
Essay 5: I do strongly this idea that teachers should assign homework to students every day. There are numerous reasons why I advocate the attitude of assigning homework everyday, and I would in here explain a few of the most important ones. 
	At first, homework is helpful for students to recall the knowledge that they study at the same day. In general, students would like to play. After going home, if there is no homework, they will only play all kinds of games. Maybe they will forget all knowledge. But homework will force them to sit their chairs to review what they learn. So, homework will help students study better. 
	Secondly, homework will help teachers understand how their students study. Through examining their students' homework, they can know whether their students understand what they teach in the class. I feel that it will help teachers improve their educational quality. 
	Of course, there are some people who contradict homework because they think that assigning homework everyday will enhance the students' load. But I feel that study is the most important task of a student. After going home, they should spend some time reviewing their knowledge. Only like this, they can acquire progress. 
	After understanding the reasoning above, I think that nobody would doubt this idea that teachers should assign homework everyday.
@Notes: 
Essay 6: Many teachers prefer to assign homework to their students everyday. Some people may think that daily homework is unnecessary and that it may be even an extra burden to children. I believe, however, it will definitely help students study their subjects well. Assigning homework to students is totally necessary for their study. 
	It is an important way of studying to assign homework to students everyday. There are a lot of ways of studying for students, such as attending classes, discussion, field trips and so forth. But doing homework is much more a direct and intensive way of studying. By doing homework, students can absorb those viewpoints that teachers have lectured in class more thoroughly and keep them deeply in mind by reviewing them over and over. 
	Children can be easily distracted by something fun at home and down street and finally spending all their time playing. That teachers assign them homework and ask for handing in when they return to school will push students to go to study as frequently as possible. Thus ensures students do well in study. 
	Also, assigning homework to students everyday will help them learn self-discipline and responsibility. Students must always remind themselves that they are students and studying is their main job rather than playing. They must realize that if they did not accomplish their homework, they would be punished by their teachers. They must know their responsibility and enforce themselves to study. These, the sense of responsibility and self-discipline, are useful qualities helping a child form to be a person. 
	Overall, it is a good idea that teachers assign homework to students everyday. It can ensure them to spend more time on studying and eventually lead to a success at study. It can also help students learn responsibility and self-discipline that will benefit them in social life in the future. For these reasons, I think that all teachers should assign homework to their students everyday.

Topic 69.	Choosing subjects to study @If you could study a subject that you have never had the opportunity to study, what would you choose? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details.
Essay 1: In a modern society, most people are easy to change jobs. However, they may feel that they don't have much confidence when facing a new job, not because of a new environment but also a lack of knowledge about the new job. Due to different requirements from different backgrounds, I think vocational education is in need. The reasons are as follow: 
	Firstly, vocational education can help us adapt to a new environment fast. Although one is doing the same job in a field, there are also differences existing in different fields. For example, an English translator needs different background knowledge if he is working in chemistry and IT field. When he translates some articles or does some interpretations about IT field, he needs to know the knowledge about IT, like the technical terms. Suppose that he doesn't know any technical terms, how can he understand some special meanings of these words, or even do a translation successfully? This is the reason that he needs some vocational training about IT, such as basic skills or common terms. Once he knows more, he will adapt the new environment fast and have a confidence in doing his job. 
	In addition, vocational education can increase a person's value. As a human being, we are learning everyday. No matter what kind of knowledge we learn, as long as they are good, we can benefit from them. This society is full of new technologies and new inventions. Of course we cannot finish learning all when we are in school. But we also cannot give up learning when starting a job. We still need to upgrade ourselves to get used to this fast-changing society. In order to achieve this goal, we need vocational education to help us. They are more practical than the knowledge we learned from schools because this knowledge you need to use everyday. Only mastering it firmly can we do the job well. 
	Last but not least, vocational education can help us to be promoted to a high level. As we know, a person to be promoted to a manager or director needs to have a thorough understanding about the job and the field he is doing. By understanding the knowledge or skills he needs, he has a strong competition against other people. In other words, he has a priority to be promoted if he knows his job well through vocational education. 
	In short, without vocational education people use what they have already learned, but they won't focus on what kind of knowledge they should learn in order to adapt their new environments, add their values and increase their competitions. Above explanations are reasons I think vocational education is very important to us. Thus, if I could study a subject that I have never had the opportunity to study, I will choose vocational education.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: If I could study a subject that I have never had opportunity to study, I would choose to study how to use the Internet. There are a lot of advantages that the Internet can bring to us. For example, it can get us informed timely, expose us to a lot of chances of knowing other peoples and their cultures, and help us obtain the materials for our studies conveniently. If I know how to use it, I can take the advantages of it. 
	The Internet can get me informed timely. There is always a lot of news on the Internet that is broadcasting 24 hours everyday and updating timely. I can read the headlines, the financial news, the sports points, and the weather reports every time when I connect my phone modem with my computer. From reading the news on the Internet, I can know everything happening around me. It is very important for me to deal with my daily life with this information. It gives me a lot of chance to know different peoples. I can know what they are thinking about and how they are living their lives. The World Wide Web Sites include all of the countries and religions’ information. I can tour internationally on Net without going out of my house. From visiting their pages, I can know more details about them. That is helpful to us since all of the peoples in the world should understand each other to make sure that we could live together peacefully. 
	The Internet gives me the convenience of getting almost any useful materials for my study. I can just type a few letters and click the search engine to get them. I can do them in the early morning in my pyjama while having my breakfast at the same time. Nothing could be more convenient than the Internet in doing research work like this. 
	In short, if I could choose one subject to study, I would definitely choose to study the Internet for its timely updating news and its convenience. I would also like to travel to new worlds and meet other different peoples. That will be really helpful for me to live a life successfully.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: If I could study a subject that I have never had the opportunity to study, I would choose computer programming, because computer programming is so vital to today’s society. 
	Firstly, computer programming is important to our daily life. With the advance of technology, we are practically facing an information age; every piece of information today is stored in the information highway, which consists of computers and networks as hardware, operating systems and software. Without software installed in these systems, the computers are like bodies without soul, and will not be able to function at all. Only with programming languages, information can be retrieved and stored into the information highway. Whether we hook up a phone line or television cable, book a ticket, travel to a foreign country, apply for a passport, an operator will immediately check our information from the computer network. If the computer systems are down, we cannot go anywhere or do anything. We can safely say that computer programming languages are ubiquitous in our daily life. 
	Secondly, computer programming is important to technological success. With the skill of computer programming, scientists can write programs to monitor their scientific research and experiments, to analyze the trend of technological development, and to forecast the future. Computer programs can simulate a scientific experiment in a much cost-effective and timely manner, thus can save scientists a lot of time and money, therefore it can greatly faster the pace of the development of technology. For example, a civil engineer can use a modeling program to simulate the water flow of an urban area; when there is a storm, he can quickly know which parts of the city have the danger of being under the water and dispatch his crew to that area to prevent the disaster. 
	Last but not least, computer programming techniques can help us earn higher salaries in our future jobs. Since computer programming is important to our society and daily life, programmers can usually have a higher salary than other professionals. Many people have shifted to computer programming from other careers during the economic boom, and even when the economy is going low at the moment, programmers and computer engineers can still live a better life than others. 
	From all above, I can safely draw a conclusion that if I have a chance to study, I would not hesitate to choose computer programming.

Topic 70.	Automobile in modern life @Some people think that the automobile has improved modern life. Others think that the automobile has caused serious problems. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: I support the statement that automobile has caused serious problems. While automobile has brought us many conveniences, it surely has brought us many undesirable consequences, of which three can be singled out: traffic congestion, air pollution, and highway accidents. 
	Automobiles have congested City streets. The problem is more obvious when the masses of motor vehicles enter or leave cities at peak traffic hours. The constantly growing number of automobiles throughout the world has made the congestion program worse and worse because planners and engineer simply cannot find a solution to keep up with the increasing volume of the traffic growth. The widespread use of automobiles for business travel has also led in many cities to a decline in public-transit systems, which result in more and more use of private cars, and exacerbate the congestion problems. 
	Air pollution is another program caused by the automobile. Automobile exhausts commonly contribute half the atmospheric pollutants in large cities and even more in cities where atmospheric and topographic conditions cause the smog formation. Although many cities require the installation of catalytic converters and other controls on motor vehicles to restrict the emission of pollutants, the concentration of many thousands of motor vehicles in large cities has given the problem a new dimension. 
	Highway accidents create a distressing toll of fatalities and injuries wherever there is widespread use of automobiles. Each year there are hundreds of thousands of motor vehicle fatalities worldwide and about 50,000 in the United States alone. The social and economic costs of such accidents are enormous. Efforts to improve highway safety have been successful in most countries, but a reduction in the ratio of fatalities and injuries per distance traveled is often offset by increases in numbers of accidents because of the ever-growing use of motor vehicles. 
	In short, automobile has brought us more bane than boon. We should take public transportation whenever possible, and reduce the number of cars running in urban streets.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Although automobiles have improved our modern life in some way for its speed, convenience, and capacity of carrying things, we have had to pay the price for it. Now, as more and more automobiles have been putting into use, the problems that the automobile has caused are seemed to be more and more serious accordingly. These problems, in my mind, like the accidents, the air pollution, and the damage of the ozone layers should be given more attention than any time before. 
	There are a lot of problems that has been causing by the automobile. It kills hundreds of thousands of people and disables many more every year. It drinks up our precious fossil fuels that cannot be replaced. New roads for the automobile also eat up our precious farmlands while many children are starving all around the world. These problems are really serious and upsetting many of us. 
	The most serious problem caused by the automobile is the air pollution. It is said that it emits millions of tons of harmful gas into the air everyday. The dirt air harms our human beings health badly. It can cause a variety of diseases such as plump, insomnia, mental disability and even certain kinds of cancer. That is really terrible. 
	Air pollution caused by the automobile can give rise to even more serious consequences. One thing, it will destroy the ozone layers that protect the lives on the earth from the hurt of the strong and direct ultraviolet rays. Much more ultraviolet can also destroy the fragile ecosystem on the earth. It is just the life circle in which we survive. Another thing is that the air pollution caused by the automobile can lead to the global warming. If the weather is getting warmer and warmer, the icebergs scattered in both of the two poles of the earth will be melted, which will cause the sea level rising and flooding all the cities and villages along the seashores. The loss of the lives and property will be countless. That is really a tremendous disaster. 
	I do not mean to deny the fact that the automobile has improved our modern life in many ways. It acts a vital role in our social life. It also supports our industries. It is indispensable in our modern life. We cannot imagine how we can live a modern life without the automobile. However, the problems it has caused today, such as the lives and properties lost, the dirty air and the consequences of the pollution, seems to be more dangerous and obvious than anytime. Therefore, it will never over due to emphasize the seriousness of these problems and urge the governments and other responsible organizations to solve them
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Since the first automobile was introduced to our life, we can notice that there are a lot of changes happened around us. As a modern transportation, it not only brings convenience to our daily life, but also enhances the efficiency. 
	One of advantages of using the automobile is that it can give the users much more convenience compared with other transportations, such as bike or bus. For me, I like to go to supermarket once per week and normal buy majority foods at one time. Can you imagine that I need to carry a lot of foodstuff and maybe take a crowded bus to reach home? How is it inconvenient! Suppose that I have a car, and then I will feel very relaxed because what I need to do is to put all my stuff at the back of the car. I can go back with nice music and happy mood of just shopping. 
	On the other hand, the automobile can save our time and energy. Driving the automobile, we can go wherever we want or even further place. We can decide the destination and reach there faster than other transportations. Assuming that a train takes about two hours to reach Suzhou from Shanghai, but a car only needs about one hour. So we can use the balance one hour to do any other things or enjoy the views first. After all, time means a lot to modern people now. It can mean money to businessmen, knowledge to school students and profit to companies. By means of cutting time with the help of the automobile, we can increase the efficiency in a society. 
	Of course, I must admit that in the meantime the automobile also brings out a lot of problems such as traffic jam and air pollution. But these outcomes cannot be avoided during the development of a society. I believe we will have a better solution to solve all these problems. 
	Generally speaking, I would like to say the automobile has improved modern life through providing more convenience to people and enhancing the efficiency. We should encourage society to support automobile industry and develop different kinds of automobiles to meet various customer needs.

Topic 71.	The salary or free time in job? @Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details.
Essay 1: There is much discussion on the relationship between income and leisure hours. Some people like high-paying jobs that demand so much work time that little time can be shared with family and friends. However, others choose lower-paying jobs that give them more leisure time. 
	Admittedly, by earning more money, one is able to purchase more expensive things, like a large house with luxury decorations. The moment he get those, he may feel great fulfillment. However, an ironic question comes up to him immediately: does he have enough time to enjoy what he has earned? Just imagine that this person spend as much as 60 percent of his life on work, while the rest 30 percent is taken up by his sleep. Whether the house is large enough makes no difference to him, and let along the decoration — he has no time to appreciate it at all. What he really need at home is only a comfortable bed. Similarly, it is true that he has sufficient money to taste delicious foods in different restaurants, but only 10 percent of his life is left for eating, so that the only choice for him is the cheap fast food sold near his work place. 
	So people should ask themselves such a serious question, “What is the purpose of our hard work?” One of the most important answers is for a better life. Maybe sometimes people make less money with shorter work hours, but they have more free time to spend with their beloveds, to experience the best moments that life offers them. An ancient Greek philosopher said, “Happiness is doubled when shared with others.” With enough leisure time, they can watch sunrise at seashore with their lovers, or count stars at a mountaintop; they may eat a wonderful dinner at their little cozy homes with their family, chatting about amusing things. All these do not need much money, but a great deal of time. 
	Furthermore, family and friends give people vital emotional support. There are countless annoying things happening in everyday life. When people drag their heavy feet back home, the warmth of family help to dispel most of their tiredness and worries. Also, when they encounter frustrations, they can confide their troubles to their friends. The consolation and encouragement from friends will turn into strings of miraculous notes to disperse their uncomfortable feelings. With little time shared with them, one will bear more and more pressures and bitterness, and run out of powers eventually. 
	From what has been discussed above, in order to lead a meaningful and pleasuring life, I prefer a lower income job that gives more free time to me to spend with my family and friends.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Some people may prefer to have a lower-paying job as long as the job asks for shorter working hours so they can have more free time spending with their friends and family. However, I would rather be given a higher-paying job with longer hours, even if I would have little time with my friends and family. I do not much care about the free time spending with my friends and family nowadays; I really care about the money. Besides, all my friends and my family members are usually busy in working. Furthermore, if I do not earn a lot of money, I cannot spend my free time with my friends and family happily. 
	I really care about the money because my budget is too tight nowadays. I am so poor a student. The tuition is too high, but I have to pay it. I also have to pay my rentals of room and pay the board. I have to pay the transportation fares, the books, the clothes and a lot of daily supplies. All these seem to be a heavy financial burden to me. So, I have to look for a job that could offer me higher salary. 
	My friends and my family members are all very busy all day long. Some of them are busy in working; others are busy in studying. They are usually having little free time to spend with their friends and families, including me. If I were given a shorter hour’s job and more free time, I could not meet them frequently either. But the money I would have lost. 
	Besides, even if my friends or my family and I have managed to find out some leisure time to spend together, if I have not gotten enough money, where the fun will be? Any meeting or party costs a fortune, even the simplest picnic. If we have no money to be spent for our gathering, we have to just sit over there and chat. We will feel boring sooner. Knowing this, I am eager for a higher-paying job so that I can get the money ready for the meetings in the future. 
	For all these reasons, I would like to have a higher-paying job to support myself and earn enough money to meet my busy friends and family someday later. Although this job cannot offer me more time to spend with my friends and family now, I believe that I will compensate it after I have become some kind of millionaire in the future.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Between a high-paying job with long hours and a lower-paying job with shorter hours, I will definitely choose a high-paying job with long hours, although I might have little time to spend with my family and friends. 
	Firstly, money can help my dreams come true. I need a lot of money to do many things. For example, I want to buy a huge house with a garden and a swimming pool. I also want to have an expensive car. Maybe my relatives need my financial assistance. Especially, I hope my family can have a kind of comfortable life. My children can go to a famous private university to get excellent education. If I have no money, all of my dreams cannot come true. 
	In addition, to me, making a lot of money is a sign of success. I think that no one respects a poor man in today's society. From newspaper to television, almost all media focus on wealthy people instead of the poor. I cannot let the others consider me an incompetent man. 
	Of course, making this choice means that I have to pay a price. Perhaps, I cannot spent too much time with my family and friends. But I never regret my decision because I believe that both my family and my friends can understand me. For my family, I think they should know whom I do this for. For my friends, they will think how success I am and they will proud of me. 
	In conclusion, money is so important to me that I must choose a high-paying job regardless of the consequences it will cause.

Topic 72.	Do marks encourage students to learn? @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Grades (marks) encourage students to learn. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.
Essay 1: Many people in the world share a belief that grades make students work hard. I agree with the above statement because I believe that high grades are more helpful in getting a bright future. 
	One of benefits of the high grade is that it promotes a learner's interest. Interest is the best motivation to encourage students to learn. If a learner has a good score in English, he will find that English is a beautiful language. For example I love to learn math, because it brings me happiness when I get a high score in a math exam. When I went to university, I select math as my major. 
	The second reason is that schools give us a chance to learn knowledge, why not try our best to get it. In our lives these knowledge has important effect on our mind which need be wise by and by. In addition, self-credit may be instruct by good marks. It is also important to our life. 
	A further solid argument for the high grade is that it means a good future career. Many companies would rather hire students who are with high grades. 
	As far as I am concerned, I come to the notion that there are main reasons why I support that grades encourage students to learn. Firstly, high scores spring learner' interests. Secondly, students get self-credit through it. Furthermore, a good job may wait these students who have high marks.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: In many schools, teachers evaluate students by their grades. Many people think that it is unfair and one-sided to evaluate students by grades and will discourage students to learn. I believe, however, grades encourage students to learn. The reasons can be analyzed as follows. 
	To begin with, using grades as standard to evaluate students can give students stress of learning. No stress, no motility. In order to get high grades, students must study hard. They must read more books, do their homework carefully. Stress makes them learn more knowledge. Stress of grades simultaneously force and encourage students to learn. 
	Grades can encourage students to compete with each other. The modern society is full of competition. Students can learn the concept of competition through grades. At the same time, they can learn the spirit of competition. To compete with others and obtain good evaluation, students must learn many techniques and get high grades. Competing grades in schools can make students more adaptable to the society. 
	Grades can also give students the feeling of success. When they get high grades through hard work, students may think that they make a great achievement. The feeling of success will encourage students to study harder and harder. At the same time, the successes in schools encourage students to find chances to succeed in society. 
	From the above analyses, it is not difficult to get the conclusion that grades encourage students to learn. Grades give students the stress and make them compete with each other so that they must study and work hard to succeed.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Almost in every modern society, grades play an import role in assessing students' academic ability. There are all kinds of tests to winnow out weak students. Knowledge itself is so complicate and vast, each one of the test usually can't cover every aspect of it. So I wonder whether grades can really encourage students to learn. 
	The basic reason why I disapprove of the title statement lies in the belief that grades usually don't have positive impact on student who is strong or weak alike. Take the example of student who has high grades: If Tom got good grades in the class, normally he can't feel conceited. This situation certainly won't lead him into finding some blind spots or weak points in his study. And he won't realize that may be just his good memorization helps him a lot or this kind of test suits him well. Let's us look another example: Suppose Johnny isn't good at memorization, but he is at home with analyze and deduction. Unfortunately, he got poor grades in tests facilitate memorization. One can foresee what harm will bring to him due to the poor grades. In all these cases, the grades play a negative role in encouraging students to learn. 
	Most important of all, the grades usually a convenient way of assessing a student's academic ability. But it is by no means a scientific one. Teachers can't determine from the grades whether the student is hardworking (diligent) or out of cram. The tests given to all students regardless of their individual's character traits, just like force everyone to wear shoes of same size. Famous educationist Confucius said two thousand years ago: "Teach students in accordance of their aptitude". Our world is a colorful world, so should be our educational world. Grades especially poor grades will frustrate greatly potential successful students to learn. It will give them a false impression that their intelligence may be inferior to other students. The worst thing about poor grades is that it may have repercussions in an underachiever's heart when all his fellow students and teacher have long forgotten. In fact, the potential talent of a student will be strangled by those poor grades. A real pity to the student himself and the society. 
	Last but not the least, there is some advantage in taking grades as a tool to evaluate students' academic performance. As in my humble opinion, they should be combine with other scientific methods to encourage students to gain knowledge but not solely focus their energy on how to win high grades. After all, it is the knowledge that it is power, not the grades.
@Notes: 
Essay 4: A lot of people claim that marks in tests encourage students to learn. I agree with this statement, because examinations are a good way for a student to review what students have learned; test scores are a standard measurement for students’ learning ability and knowledge level; and the test system can benefit their future. 
	First of all, tests are important for students’ learning. Attending classes is not enough for students to learn the subjects no matter how carefully they listen to what teachers say. They need examinations to review the lessons. In most cases, grades or marks are the only means by which teachers measure students’ learning ability and learning progress. Therefore, grades encourage students to study for examinations, and it is good system for them to learn the subjects. 
	Secondly, test scores are a standard measurement for students’ learning ability and knowledge level. Most people would agree with this, therefore universities all over the world take test results as a standard measurement to give admission to new students, to offer fellowships, and to decide whether to grant a student graduation. High school teachers use test results as a means to evaluate the effects of teaching, and students’ learning progress. By test scores, teachers also know each individual student’s ability to learn. 
	Thirdly, test results can stimulate a student to work hard on his courses. The testing mechanism encourages students to work hard in order to achieve a better result; they will devote more time on study, and develop a "never give up" spirit. This will not only benefit their study, but also teach them a truth, that everyone needs constant learning and hard working in order to be useful to this society. Students who have developed such learning habit and never give up nature will not only have good performance in schools, but can also superior to others in other aspects; for example, such natures are important factors even after finishing schools. I believe most students understand the importance of these qualities and impacts on their life; therefore they know how important it is to work hard and try to achieve a better score. 
	In conclusion, marks can stimulate student to learn, and good marks can give them advantages in going to a good university and finding a good job. Therefore I strongly support the statement that marks can encourage students to learn.

Topic 73.	Computers and the life of people @Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: The use of computer is increasingly popular in modern society. Some people think that the computer makes life more convenient and easier because they can compile documents, buy goods through the Internet and do other works on the computer. Nevertheless, in my opinion, the computer makes life more complex and stressful. There are many instances supporting my opinion. 
	Before the computer was invented, people only need to learn the knowledge of mathematics, physics, chemistry and so on. However, today people have to learn how to operate the computer, to use a variety of software and if the computer does not work, people have to learn how to repair it. People have to learn not only the knowledge of software but also that of hardware. No ending learning makes people exhausted and their life more complex. 
	The computer also makes life more stressful. The society in which we live is called "information society & quotes”. Thanks for the development of the computer, the rhythm of life are increasingly rapid. The business men has so many meetings to attend, so many e-mails to deal with that they have no time to have his lunch. Some students have to work late on the computer to do the homework at night. There are more and more people struggling from the nervous sickness and complaining the "busy life". 
	The rapid development of the computer makes people feel stressful, too. The new generation of the software and the hardware, the update of them, all of these make people have to pay more and more time and money on their computers. 
	Although the computer has become an indispensable part of our life, it can be concluded from the above statements that the computer makes life more complex and stressful.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Some people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful, but I totally disagree. In my opinion, computers have really made our lives easier and more convenient in communicating, getting informed and doing research work, if you have known how to work with a computer. 
	The e-mail service and Internet based on computer make us communicating with others much easily and conveniently. In the past, we have to write letters or meet in person in order to communicate with others. The mails seem to take forever to arrive and meeting in person means to put out a lot of efforts. Now, the e-mail lasts only a few seconds to send and to receive and we can always meet new people even foreigners in chat room whenever we set up our computers. It really makes our socializing easier. 
	The news on the Internet is being broadcasted 24 hours everyday and tailored to your specific interests. You can always connect your telephone and modem with a computer to read them. Listening to radio or watching television can be informed with what are happening around you conveniently too, but just on the computer can you easily read the specific news in which you are interested without having to buy newspapers. So, up to now, it is the most convenient way to read news at home. 
	Besides, it is very convenient and much easy to do research work with a computer turning on. You can save your work on computers too easily more than just typing a few letters, no matter what your work is, even audio or video data. You can also type a few keys to print them out neatly. Also, you can search whatever materials you want without the trouble of looking for books or magazines in libraries. 
	Some people think that computers have made life complex and stressful. They may not be very familiar with computers or do not know how to work with a computer efficiently. It does not matter. Only after a few weeks of training, they can probably easily enjoy the convenience of computers in socializing, reading news and doing research job.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Some people believe that computers provide easier and more convenient lives for them. In their opinion, computers help them surf internet and share information. They may communicate directly by Email. But others hold that computers have made life more complex and stressful and they point out that computers bring many bad effects to human beings, such as information security problem because of hacking attack and environmental pollution because of irradiation. As far as I concerned, I prefer the first opinion rather than the second view. 
	My opinion comes from following three aspects. First of all, computer made life more efficient than before. For example, people might access websites, gain a lot of valuable information and contact each other around the world. Secondly, computer made life more relax and easier. Computers provide variety kinds of games and people could enjoy and relax from them everyday. Finally, compute help people solve many complicated problem by software, such as investment and finance. Therefore, people’s life become more simple and convenient. 
	However, just as what other people say that computers give us some negative effects in the meantime. For example, Irradiation does harm for our bodies and eyes, so we cannot made people seat too long in front of computers. Hacking is a really trouble, and we are supposed to enhance computer control and technology. 
	In general, computers give people an easier and convenient life. Although there exists some bad effects of computers as mentioned above. We are supposed to do our best to solve the problems and pay more attention on their good effects. I believe that our society will benefit more from them in the future.
@Notes: 
Essay 4: Nowadays some may hold the opinion that computers have made life easier and more convenient, but others have a negative attitude; they say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. As far as I am concerned, I agree that computers have brought more advantages than disadvantages to our life. My arguments for this point are listed as follows. 
	One of the primary causes is that computers have improved the quality of life in our society. They have brought to us more conveniences than ever before: whether we book a plane ticket, arrange a travel to foreign countries, or hook up a telephone line, with the help of computers and modern technologies, they can be done in a few minutes by simply a phone call or a few key strokes; we will not have to run from one place to another, and wait for thousands of years before we can get the services we want. 
	There is a further more subtle point we must consider. Because computers can make use of more personal details about people, companies can provide customers with more individualized service than before. Take booking for a plane ticket for example, as soon as the operator input our name and telephone number into the computer, the system can retrieve our information from the database, and it will analyze our previous traveling patterns and habits, and decide the best fair, airline, traveling time and seating for us. The computer can also arrange accommodations after we arrive at the destination. All these can be done in just a few seconds. 
	What is more, computers give people more convenient access to useful information and services. Nowadays computers and internet is ubiquitous in every corner of our world. We use computers in libraries and public agencies to check up for useful information and the books we need. Furthermore we access internet or CD-ROM to get whatever information we want. Before traveling to a new place, we can check on the computer what the place looks like, what spots are must-sees, and how we can get there. We can get information from the internet on how to get a driver’s license, how to write an article on a topic, and even take simulation tests on a specific subject. The computer is such a great learning and information tool! 
	Recognizing the fact that computer is so indispensable to our daily life, we can safely conclude that computers have made life easier and more convenient for us.

Topic 74.	The best way to travel @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: There are a lot of views whether the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Different people has different viewpoint. In my opinion, a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel. The argument for this view goes as follows: 
	In the first place, there are many advantages when people travel in a group. First, people will not feel boring in a long trip. People can talk, laugh and make joking like a big family. Second, the group will help you a lot when you have any emergency. The people in the group could help you figure out the awkward situation that will be unimaginable when you travel alone. Third, with the group discount, such as the discount for airplane ticket, the hotel, and the admission ticket, travelers can save a lot of money when they use the group discount. 
	In the second place, there are many advantages too when people travel led by a tour guide. The tour guide will arrange all the details about the trip in advance. The traveler need not worry about where to find the hotel, where to rent the car, and how to find the direction. It will make the trip a little bit easy. Another advantage is that led by a tour guide will save much time than traveling alone. With the professional knowledge, tour guide will make the smartest schedule. I would never forget that one of my friend, a city tour guide in the Shanghai, China, said that she can lead traveler to visit the whole city by one day which people should spend two or three days to finish it. 
	In conclusion, there are many advantages when people travels in a group led by a tour guide, such as save money, save time, do not feel boring, and is easy to take care of. Therefore, I strongly agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: No doubt, I do strongly advocate this idea that the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide. There are numerous reasons why I agree with this opinion, and I would in here explain a few of the most important ones. 
	At first, I can get many conveniences if I travel in a group led by a tour guide. I don't worry about some things such as residence, transportation, and eating. During the whole journey, I can completely enjoy the pleasure of traveling without being disturbed by some trivial things. 
	Another reason why I agree with this idea is that traveling with a group people is more enjoyable than traveling alone. We can share with the beautiful view each other and can express our feeling each other. In addition, if I encounter certain difficulties, there will be many people to help me. So, this traveling pattern will also more safe. 
	The last reason is that a tour guild will let us learn more knowledge about where we will go because we aren't familiar with that place. Maybe due to our ignorance, we will miss many interesting places without a tour guild. 
	Understanding the reasoning above, it is quite safe now to say: the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guild.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Some people may think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide, but it is just where I differ from those people. I think the best way to travel is to travel alone. If I travel alone, I can enjoy the pleasure of meeting new people, trying new things and totally relaxing. However, if I am to travel with a group led by a tour guide, this pleasure seems impossible. 
	Travel alone means that I can meet new people more freely. I can meet not only the other travelers, but also the local residents whenever I travel to a new place. If the person I want to meet is not available at the present time, I can even reschedule my time. But if I travel in a group led by a tour guide, I have to stick to the schedule. I have to take other people’s time into consideration. That means I will lose a lot of chances to meet new people. 
	Travel alone also means I can try new things personally. I can go anywhere I want and do something different from my lifestyle. However, if I travel in a group, the place where I go and the things that I will deal with are all arranged and fixed in advance. I have no choice but to follow. That will be miserable for me as a traveller. 
	When I finally mange to take a travel, I want to relax myself totally. Work is too hard to do and I am really eager to have an enjoyable break. However, I am in a group and I have to stick to the travel schedule, to consider the other group members’ feelings, to go wherever the tour guide leads to. That seems just like I am on my duty at work again. I cannot really get relaxation. 
	I always prefer to travel alone. I would like to meet a lot of different people, experiencing new things on my way in traveling. I think that only scheduling my travel time more casually can make me relax completely. Would not that be the only purpose of traveling? I would like to encourage you to travel alone too. In any case, do not travel in a group led by a tour guide.
@Notes: 
Essay 4: There are basically two ways of traveling: traveling in a group led by a tour guide, or traveling independently. There are advantages and disadvantages of the both. By traveling in a group, you will enjoy the companionship, comfort and safety of group travel, and learn more information about the place from a tour guide; while traveling independently, you can maintain the freedom, flexibility and individualism. Some people say that for most people, the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. I agree with this opinion. 
	Firstly, you will enjoy the companionship when traveling in a group. Usually a tour group consists of around 20 people. These people travel together, eat together and stay in the same hotel. During the trip, you can always find someone you like to talk with, and you will never feel lonely as when you are travelling alone. 
	Secondly, you will enjoy the comfort and safety of group travel. When traveling in a group, everything is pre-arranged by the travel agent, and you do not have to worry about booking a ticket, finding a hotel, decide what places to visit, and so on. In the meantime, as you are not preoccupied with arranging the trip by yourself, you may find yourself concentrate more on the trip itself and enjoy it more. In addition, it is much safer to travel in a group. Your personal safety is always taken care of by others. 
	Thirdly, you can learn more information about the place from a tour guide, and not worrying about missing an important spot. The tour guide will take you to each spot that should be visited, and give you detailed information about the place you visit. You never have to find information about the places you are going to through the Internet or buy a book from the bookstore. Traveling in a group can save you time and money on information searching. 
	In conclusion, there are many advantages of traveling in a group. Although for young people, traveling alone is more advantages and stimulating, for most people, traveling in a group is the best choice.

Topic 75.	Students taking classes @Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: Some universities require students to choose a variety of subjects; others only require students to specialize in one subject. I deem the first one as the premier choice. Among countless factors, there are three conspicuous aspects as follows. 
	The main reason for my propensity that students should take classes in many subjects is that they can make full use of the abundant resources that a university has to offer. A university has plenty of educational and research resources. It is a very good idea to make full use of these valuable assets while studying in the university. The best way to achieve this is to take a variety of subjects as much as possible. Through learning these courses, a student can get access to knowledge and resources in different areas. On the contrary, if a student only specializes in one subject, he will not have a chance to get access to other resources offered by the university. 
	Another reason can be seen by every person is that by choosing many subjects students can broaden their knowledge and make a solid foundation for their future concentrated study. Whatever the student will concentrate on in his senior years in college, it is necessary that he choose a wide range of subjects to build the knowledge foundation. Take the field of Business Management for example, the student has to acquire knowledge in writing, accounting, economics and human resource management before he can successfully start his major concentration study. 
	The argument I support in the first paragraph is also in a position of advantage because students can be more adaptable in their future career if they choose a variety of subjects during their university study. It is obvious that the development of modern society requires people with interdisciplinary and comprehensive knowledge. If a student chooses a variety of subjects in his university study, and gained a breath and width of knowledge, he will be more adaptable to the requirement of the society, and be able to easily adjust too many kinds of jobs. This will benefit his future career. 
	In a word, taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that students should take classes in many subjects in a university.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: The whole point of my answer is that it is better for universities to require students to specialize in one subject. It is just what the majors are called for, even though there are a couple of the advantages of students’ taking classes in many subjects. 
	It is a more sensible decision that universities require students to specialize in one subject. They must have known that the depth of a certain subject is infinite while both the students’ energy and time are limited. It probably tells the truth. Only when a student just specializes in one subject, can he focus on it. Thus it ensures the students more likely to be a kind of expert in some subject when they are given the degrees. That is just the purpose of so-called education. 
	It does not mean that students have not too many classes to attend even if they just specialize one subject. There are a lot of sub-subjects or divisions of a main subject. The science of journalism, for example, can include the theories of journalism, the histories of journalism both domestic and international, the news writing skills, the interview courses and the editorials writing and so on. The students have to study all of these above course as journalism major. It does mean a lot of work to do even if students just specialize one subject. 
	I do not deny there are a couple of advantages for universities to require students to take in many subjects. One thing, the work places require so-called generalist today. Students who take many subjects may probably mean the opportunity of meeting that request. Another is that students who take in many subjects can also help their main subject. Thus probably can help them study what they are majoring better. Whatever the benefit it will be, however, students taking any other subjects should not interfere their main target. 
	In the whole, I thought that universities could allow students to take subjects as many as possible if their times and energies were available. However, I think that possibility is faint. So I have to say that it is better for universities just to urge students to specialize in one subject. After all, the main subject is already a lot of work to cope with, considering the depth and width of one subject.
