Topic 26.	Building a new movie theater @It has recently been announced that a new movie theater may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.
Essay 1: I know from the media that a new movie theater may be built in my neighborhood. Going to see a movie is one of the most common ways of entertainment. With the movie theater nearby, I could go to see a movie more convenient. However there are more reasons to oppose the building of a new heater, especially near our community. 
	If the movie theater is built in our neighborhood, it certainly provides us the convenience to see a movie. We no longer need to drive downtown to see it, but walk to the movie theater after dinner without any hassle. It will save a lot of time on the way to the theater. And we will never worry about finding a parking lot. 
	However, the movie theater nearby will also bring some problems. First, the noise of the people going to the theater will bother other people in the community. The movies usually end very late. People who enjoy the movies will certainly discuss it when stepping out the theater. Some people will argue or even cry for the movie. Furthermore, the noise of the cars' engines will make the condition worse. The people who live in the community nearby will suffer from the noises of people and cars. 
	Another disadvantage of building a movie theater nearby lies that it will cause traffic jam during the hours people going home. People who live far away will drive to the theater. These cars together with the cars of the people after work will pose a heavy burden on the traffic system of the town. The traffic jam will not only make many people late for the movie, but also bring us who live nearby bad moods before going home. 
	Considering the advantage and disadvantage factors above, I oppose to build a new movie theater in my neighborhood, because the problems outweigh the benefits. We usually see movies once a month. I cannot afford suffering from the traffic jams and noises in the late evening throughout the month except for the day I amble there to see a movie.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: It has recently been announced that a new movie theatre may be built in my neighborhood. However, as far as I am concerned, I do not support this plan. The argument of my view goes as follows: 
	To begin with, people seldom go out to watch movie nowadays. With the development of science and technology, people have a lot of methods to enjoy themselves. They can watch TV at home, go to watch the soccer game, play basketball and so on. In my hometown, fewer and fewer choose to watch movie in a theater. They prefer to watch movie on TV at home, which is more comfortable. 
	In addition, I think there are enough theatres now. As I know, it is only fifteen minutes' walk between the two theaters in my community. As a result, it is obvious unnecessary to build the third one. If we do build another theatre, the average persons per theater will decrease, which makes every theater earns less money. 
	Last but not least, it is, to some degree, a waste of money. Nowadays, we must use money in quite a number of fields. For instance, there is only one primary school here. It takes some children half an hour to go to school from their home. If we can build another school instead of the theatre, students will spend less time on their way, which is safer because there are many buses and cars on the road. 
	In conclusion, it must be explained that these three reasons sometimes intertwine to form an organic whole and thus become more persuasive than any one of them. Then any thinking person must agree that it is not necessary to build a movie theatre.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Some people will say that a new movie theater in our neighborhood would be a bad thing. However, I fully support the plan to build one. I feel that a movie theater would bring more opportunities for recreation, reduce teenage delinquency, and lead to several improvements in the town. 
	As it stands, there is little to do in my town. There are no parks here, and there is certainly no nightlife. Additionally, the nearest movie theater is more than thirty minutes away. That is inconvenient for everyone here. Many movies end late at night. Who wants a long drive home at 11:30 p.m. or midnight? 
	Building a new movie theater here will reduce juvenile delinquency. Like everyone else, teens here are bored. They need activities to keep them busy and out of trouble. The jobs that the theatre will provide will help teens, too. We need more businesses that are willing and eager to employ young people. 
	Overall, the new theater will bring many improvements to the town. For example, it will help other businesses. That is because the movie theater will attract customers from neighboring towns. Those neighbors do not have a reason to come to this town now. However, if they are coming here for a movie, they will be more likely to stay here to shop. If we get more visitors, we'll need better roads. While this may be costly, it will also make travel easier for people living here. We will be able to get around faster. Safety will be improved with the new roads, because they will be in better condition than many that we have now. 
	I believe that our town needs a new movie theater. Again, I support it fully. I hope that others in our community will join me to convince residents and local government.

Topic 27.	Doing things that we don't enjoy doing @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: I agree that people should sometimes do things that they don't enjoy doing. This is a basic part of being an adult. Plus, some things that aren't "fun" are still good for us in the long run. 
	Take personal tasks. Who enjoys going to the dentist? Very few people enjoy having their annual check-up with the doctor. Not a lot of people enjoy changing the oil in their car or mowing their lawns. These are all things we do because we have to, not because we want to. We realize that taking care of our physical health is the sensible thing to do. We know that if we don't change the oil in our cars, our cars won't run. We understand that grass grows and if we don't mow it, our lawns will look like tropical forests. 
	Professional tasks are another part of the same equation. No one likes to be stuck with a boring assignment or to be told we have to work with someone no one else gets along with. Sometimes we have to put up with unfair criticism from a supervisor or resentment from those we supervise. If we're in management, we may have had the unpleasant task of having to fire someone. None of these are fun things. Unfortunately, they're all part of earning a living, something the majority of adults have to do. 
	On the other hand, sometimes doing something we don't enjoy doing can lead to enjoyment. Simply by trying it again, we may decide we like doing it. For instance, we may have convinced ourselves we hate to dance. We agree to go to a club only to please someone else. Yet, for some reason, this time we enjoy dancing. We've been cheating ourselves of enjoyment without even knowing it. The same can be true of trying new foods or going to a new type of museum. Doing what we don't enjoy doesn't always have to be a bother, does it? It's just part of life.

Topic 28.	Media and famous people's live @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.
Essay 1: I think the media pay too much attention to the private lives of famous people. Television, newspapers, magazines and web sites dig up all kinds of past bad actions. They say that these are true reflections of a person's character. This may be true if they occurred only a few years before, but some of these are things people did as teenagers. People in their forties are expected to explain something they did when they were fifteen. If they killed someone, obviously that's more than a youthful mistake. Usually, though, these incidents involve experiments with drugs or being reckless in a car. They're not something that the public needs to know. 
	The media love to say that the public has a right to know. That's not true. We don't need to know if a movie star or politician has had an extramarital affair. That is something of concern only to the people involved. We do need to know if someone we're electing to public office has been involved in shady business deals, but we don't need to know if he or she defaulted on a loan twenty years ago. 
	It seems the media dig up these facts without giving thoughtful consideration to what might happen. It has an effect on the celebrity's family, especially the children. A celebrity's good name and credibility may be ruined before he or she can prove that rumors are false. If a case goes to court, paying a lawyer can use up all their money. Even if it doesn't come to that, they may find their career ruined. 
	When are we, the public, going to make it clear to the media that we're tired of having to watch this kind of thing on the news? Wouldn't it be better if they would concentrate on more important issues?
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Santa told a famous man in front of a flashing, well decorated Christmas tree, "You could make three wishes, and just only three best wishes for the coming new year." Would you be eager to know what the three wishes are? Then, he wished: "firstly, may God send me my own calm and tranquil personal life without any interventions; Secondly, I want to keep myself and my family away from spotlights and all the media focuses as far as possible. Last but not least, all what I have wished is the very secret between God and me. 
	To think a well-known man standing high above the masses, to our surprise, was making such a hard and transparent living. It is certain that everyone has their curiosity, and in their image- nation famous people are so perfect that there should be no flaw in their lifetime. But how could that be? As an old saying goes, "No man is infallible. “In my opinion, therefore, media has negative effects on their personal life. 
	I feel that this phenomenon suggests that those who are interested in famous people's personal life are, in fact, jealous of their achievements. Almost every successful figure has experienced failure, rubs and what they have owned today proves that their efforts are paid off. A winner has a zest for life, work, play, food, other people and the world of nature, also enjoys his own accomplishments without guilty. Why do they soar when others sink? It depends on your own effort and diligence. 
	A celebrated public figure has ever said," Winners have different potentials. Achievement is not the most important thing. Authenticity is. The authentic person experiences the reality of himself by known- in himself, being himself and becoming a credible, responsive person. Indeed television, magazines and other media needn't pay so much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrates. 
	Please never rehearse another tragedy of Diana, a beloved British princess who now may enjoy her calm life in the paradise .What most deeply impressed me in Diana's eulogy is - How great she suffering is, we cannot even imagine...

Topic 29.	Earth and human activity @Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed (damaged) by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: People have been living on the Earth for thousands of years. Human activity influences the Earth. Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. In my opinion, the earth is being damaged by human activity. There are many statements supporting my opinion. 
	Human activity has damaged natural environment and almost exhausted natural resources. Modern industry needs more and more resources, including minerals, fuels and water. So we confront of the serious problems such as the lack of fuels and water. Ecological balance is damaged because factories occupy many places where animals and plants live. More and more buildings are constructed and forests become less and less. If we cannot recognize these problems and solve them soon, we would finally lose the environment suitable for our living. 
	Another serious problem is "the green-house effect." Human activity decreases forests and increases the usage of fuels so that the gas of carbon dioxide is output more and more and there are not enough plants to absorb it. The green-house effect is more obvious and more sensible these years. Due to the effect, icebergs in the south polar and north polar melt and the sea level becomes higher than before. I am worried about the cities nearby the sea and hope scientists find an effective method to eliminate the green-house effect. 
	Although we have advanced machines and our life seems more comfortable than before, we have less chances to approach natures and less spaces to act. The cities become bigger and if we want to have a picnic with our friends, we have to drive a long distance to find a natural place. In fact, the spaces of human activity are being damaged by the skyscrapers and factories. 
	From the above statements, we can conclude that human activity brings the Earth many damages. Fortunately people have recognized the point and I believe that the Earth will become a better place to live with our ceaseless efforts.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Nowadays our Earth faces a number of serious problems, such as the environment pollution, the increasing population, the fatal effects of nuclear weapons, and so on. So some people believe that the Earth is being harmed by human activity. But as far as I am concerned that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live and also makes some negative effects in this process. My arguments for this point are listed as follows. 
	Even though we face so many crisis, no one can deny that Earth are more suitable for human habitation. That is the result of the efforts of generations of people. If without that, we might also live in caves and eat the crude food just like wild animals. If that is true, we must haven’t time and energy to think over the problems of the Earth because we have to look for food and avoid becoming the food of other animals. At that state, whether the Earth were harmed is not important for human because some certain crises can annihilate the total population, such as some infectious disease or the change of climates. 
	It is inevitable to produce some positive aspect functions when human are struggle to improve the survive abilities and from the experiences of history we also have make great effort to resolve this kinds of problems. For example, most of people hope to limit the scope of nuclear weapons and the protection of environment is accept by almost every one. Most of problems are controlled by ourselves and some of them have the hope to be resolved in years. We are finding the balance between the development and the protection of our Earth. So it is unnecessary to deny the advancement of human. 
	For the reasons presented above, we admit that there are some problems in the process of the human development, but those problems are resolving and as a whole we make the Earth a better place to live. Human evolved in the mode of continuing to correct their mistakes and making a better progress.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: The quality of human life has improved greatly over the past few centuries, but Earth is being harmed more and more by human activity. As we develop our technology, we demand more from our planet. Eventually, this will harm people as well. 
	Our planet gives us everything we need, but natural resources are not endless. Strip mining devastates whole regions, leaving bare and useless ground. Deforestation removes old growth trees that can't be replaced. Too much fishing may harm fish populations to the point where they can't recover. We are too careless in taking what we want without giving anything back. 
	There are more people than ever, living longer than ever. So is it any surprise that many areas suffer from too much development? Anyone living in or near a city has experienced "urban sprawl." There is a new shopping area on every corner and new houses, townhouses and apartments everywhere. Traffic gets worse and worse because planners can't keep up with growth. Keeping up with human demand is hard enough. Environmental concerns come in last. 
	With growth comes pollution. Companies and communities dump waste into water. Landfills are full of trash. Emissions from factories pollute the air. Barrels of industrial waste and worse, radioactive waste, have no safe place to go. If we're not careful, we can harm our planet beyond repair. 
	People need to respect the Earth and try to preserve it. If we don't, what kind of future will we have?

Topic 30.	Building a new high school @It has recently been announced that a new high school may be built in your community. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details in your answer.
Essay 1: I oppose having a new high school built in my neighborhood. Although I know there's a real need for a new facility, I have to say that I don't want one built so close to me. I think it would cause a lot of problems. 
	First of all, there are very few teenagers in this neighborhood, or in our suburban subdivision, for that matter. Most of the residents here are either retired or are just starting out with young children. This means that the kids coming to the new high school wouldn't be walking. They would come on buses or would be driving to the school. Either way, this would mean a lot more traffic on our streets. 
	In addition to the traffic on school days, there also would be traffic whenever there was a sporting event, such as a basketball or football game, or activities at the school. Would there be enough parking in the school lot for everyone attending those events? Probably not. Consequently, those extra cars would end up in our neighborhood. 
	My neighbors and I would also be upset about the loss of the park, which is the site that's been selected for the high school. Mothers with young children gather there every morning for their kids to play together. People my age like to take a walk after dinner. On weekends, that park is a place for picnics and relaxation. We'd be sorry to lose our neighborhood park. 
	I also have some concerns about all those young people being in our neighborhood. Would there be problems with drugs or fights? Could the school district guarantee us that security would be apriority? These are concerns that I don't think can be addressed sufficiently for me to support a new high school in my neighborhood.

Topic 31.	Staying or moving? @Some people spend their entire lives in one place. Others move a number of times throughout their lives, looking for a better job, house, community, or even climate. Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.
Essay 1: Even though I have lived in the same house, in the same neighborhood, in the same city my entire life, I know I would be happy living in a variety of places. Moving would expose me to new people, new weather, and new housing. 
	Even if I were to move to another part of my city, I would encounter new people. Each neighborhood has a distinct personality. When I move to that neighborhood, I would meet the shopkeepers and residents that shape that personality. I may even adopt part of their manner as my own so I could be recognized as part of that community. 
	If I want to encounter different weather patterns, I would have to move beyond my city. Where I live now, it is the same temperature all year. I would like to go to a place where there are four seasons so I can experience really cold temperatures. I would like to walk in the snow and perhaps go skiing. I could learn winter sports if I lived in the north. 
	Now, of course, I live with my parents in their home. It is a one story house built around a courtyard where our family spends a lot of time. If I were to move, I would like to live in an apartment on a very high floor so I could see all around me. I could also meet my neighbors in the elevator and we could get together for coffee in my apartment. 
	The more I move the more I would experience change. I would meet new people in everyplace I lived; I could move to sample countries with four seasons or even a continent like Antarctica which only has two. Wherever I lived, I would experience living in housing particular to that area. I would then be a citizen of the world, wouldn't I? Could you call me a foreigner if I called everyplace my home?
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Some people spend their entire lives in one place. Others move many times throughout their lives in order to looking for a better job, house, community, or even climate. As far as I am concerned, the latter is more enjoyable than the former. The reasons for this view go as follows: 
	In the first place, some people have found a better job far away where they live currently. In this kind of situation, do you move for the better career or do you still live in the old place where you are already familiar with everything nearby. Absolutely, I will choose moving not only because it gives me a good career but also because moving is very exciting. 
	In the second place, moving is very exciting. Fining a new house, buying the new furniture, all of these are wonderful thing. For example, if I move, I want find a single house instead of the town house, which I live now, because a single house can possess more grass, which my son love very much. Moreover, I want choose a big kitchen that all my family can sit a big dinner table and have dinner together. 
	In the third place, living in a place in all my live looks like too boring for me. Moving to different place, I can enjoy different community and different climate. For example, I can enjoy the mild temperature in the South America, and also I do not miss the beautiful snow in the northern. 
	From what I have discussed above, moving is exciting not only because it gives me a new job opportunities but also because it can let me enjoy the beach of south and the snow in the north. Therefore, I prefer moving in search of another place instead of staying in one place.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Some people hold the opinion that living in one place is superior to moving in search another place. Others, however, contradict it. Personally, I would like to vote for moving to another place. There are no less than three advantages in it as rendered below: 
	First and foremost, moving to another place may contribute to one's development. People always choose a better place than their present ones to be their destination. That way, they can learn some new knowledge, communicate with new friends and find some more chances. Those who change their majors may learn even more. There will be a new world open to them. So, moving to another place is really good for us. 
	There is another factor that deserves some words here. Changing their characters or habits may be one of lots of reasons for some people's moving. For instance, if you do not like your present statue, you should try to move to a new place which you have not been to. Certainly, your mood and attitude will change with the new circumstance. 
	In addition, if you like to make friends, moving to a new place will be fit for you. When you come to a new place, you will communicate with some new friends, and you can help each other. So, changing a place will make you more sociable. 
	It is undeniable that staying in one place has its own merits. You can do your work step by step. You will spend lots of time with your ole friends, and you can feel comfortable in the place with which you are very familiar. 
	Nonetheless, I still prefer moving to another place constantly. Because I can make new friends, look for some chances and become more experienced. I love changes.
@Notes: 
Essay 4: It seems like the world is becoming smaller and smaller, almost by the minute. When I was a child, I had never met anybody from outside my hometown, much less somebody from another country. However, nowadays I routinely interact with people from all over the world. I might discuss a topic with my classmates from Iran, Korea, Brazil, or Palestine; buy computer parts from the shop run by Chinese; have lunch at a Mexican restaurant; or buy Russian pastries at the café near my house. In these experiences I can see the product of a world in which borders are falling and people are free to move about as they wish. There is nothing more invigorating for me than being a part of this emerging "global village." 
	I have now lived in three different countries, Argentina, France, and the United States and am convinced that I am a better person for it. In each country I found something different. I remember the warmth of the human interaction of my hometown in Argentina; I enjoyed the great sense of culture and wit in France; in the United States, I am impressed by the feeling of liberty and acceptance. In each country I have learned a different language, experienced a different climate, and conversed with people in different ways. I have learned that each place has something special about it and that no place on Earth is a perfect place. We may lose one thing when we leave a country, but we always gain something else in its place. 
	So, the greatest benefit of having met so many people from all over the world has been learning that each person and each culture has a different yet valid way of seeing the world. I cannot say that Argentines have a monopoly on how to view the world; nor can I say that the American system of doing things is best. I can only say that from my experience each system works for each culture and that each one is a valid way of seeing the world. 
	Perhaps this point is the most important one for the coming age of information and technology and falling political and trade barriers. As people from all over the world migrate more freely in search of better lives, they will necessarily have to learn to be tolerant of different worldviews. People who do will learn to accept people who do y and perhaps even experiment with the new way. By accepting cultures different from our own, we learn more of the broad range of the human experience and we are richer people for seeing beauty and truth in its many forms.
@Notes: 
Essay 5: Moving a number of times throughout their lives, looking for a better job, house, community, or even climate, are the right attitude to the life. I prefer this opinion. 
	For somebody who spend their entire lives in one place, they can only know the outside of hometown by television, newspaper and books. They may live with unhappy environments such as cold, sand storm and pollution. Only know somebody who is old classmate and have a few people can talk with. So, their knowledge is less than somebody who like to move. 
	If you would like to move from one place to another you can find one that is your choise. You will happy with the climate and enjoy the fresh air and sun shine. It is easy to keep your body healthy. You will be feeling fresh and getting new friend with. You will get different new idea about the life. The new culture will give you more knowledge, more interesting. Furthermore, you can make more new friendship to help each other. 
	So I prefer to move and search another place rather than spend my entire lives in one place. One of the famous man said: the tree will be died after moved, but man alive.

Topic 32.	How do you use your money? @Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.
Essay 1: "Save it for rainy day," That's my motto. When I have a choice between spending my money and putting it in my savings account at the bank, I always put it in the bank. I will have a lot of expenses in the future like my education, travel, and unforeseen emergencies. I need to have money set aside for these expenses. 
	Education is expensive. I can't depend on my parents to pay all my bills. I have tuition, room and board, books, and incidental expenses to pay for. I'll try to get a scholarship to cover some of these costs, but I know I will be responsible for a lot of the expenses. If I spend my money now, I won't be able to pay for my education. I need to save money for my education. 
	Travel is also very expensive. I don't mean vacation travel. I mean travel to get to and from school. Transpacific airfare costs a lot even special reduced fares. I first have to get to school and then, of course, I want to return to my family for important festivals and occasions. Going back and forth will be costly, but worth it. I need to save money for these trips. 
	Emergencies could arrive at any moment. I might have an unexpected illness while I am at school. There might be costs that aren't covered by the school insurance. One of my family members may need help. I will have to send them money. You can't predict emergencies like this, but you can be prepared. I need to save money for these emergencies. 
	When you are not rich, you cannot spend your money carelessly. You must plan ahead. I know in my life, I will have expenses for my schooling and for traveling to and from my home. I know that I will also have unexpected expenses related to unforeseen emergencies. I must be prepared. I need to save money for these events.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: When faced with the decision of saving your money for some time in the future or enjoying your money when you earn it, quite a few would claim to enjoy their money, but others, in contrast, deem to save their money as the premier choice and that is also my point. This quite different view is based on the every possible reason. 
	For most reason for saving the money for future use is when you need a lot of money to deal with some emergent things that happen to you, you should not worry about the fund or lend some money everywhere at that time. For example, two years ago, I spend my summer holiday in a famous scenery pot, after a wonderful trip of the first day, I lost my wallet unconsciously, and then I took out some money in the bank to finish the trip. If you did not have some deposit, you can imagine how embarrassed you are. 
	Second, I have finished my college study, and I am going to go abroad to get a master degree to enhance the ability to face the challenge in the society. Plenty of money is very important to me, so I have to save all the money that I economized for future use. 
	Third, the economy condition of my family is not so good that I decide to earn enough money to buy a big house for my deeply loving parents. 
	This is arbitrary to judge saving money for future use according only to the excuse I mentioned in the above paragraph. But I do not deny that enjoying the life is also important to everyone because of brief life. That is to say, I will enjoy my money if I deposit enough.

Topic 33.	A jewelry or tickets to a concert @You have received a gift of money. The money is enough to buy either a piece of jewelry you like or tickets to a concert you want to attend. Which would you buy? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.
Essay 1: The choice between spending money on tickets to a concert and spending money on jewelry is an easy one. Given this choice, I would buy jewelry. The reasons are obvious. Jewelry is an investment; it is permanent; and it is fashionable. 
	Jewelry like a gold bracelet for example is a very good investment. It is important for women (and for men, too) to have gold jewelry. If you have some serious financial problem, you could always set your jewelry to help you over any rough spots. You could not sell your used concert ticket. 
	Jewelry, unless you sell it, is permanent. You always have it to wear. Each time you put it on, you will remember the day you bought it. It will give you pleasure for years and years. You could not wear the ticket stub from the concert. 
	Jewelry is very fashionable. I would feel very smart wearing a beautiful gold bracelet or diamond pin. People would comment and tell me how much they loved my jewelry. They would complement me on my good taste. 
	I would feel very rich with my jewelry. I would have a good investment which is permanent and fashionable. Then, when someone invites me to a concert (and pays for my ticket), I will have something beautiful to wear.

Topic 34.	Businesses and employees @Businesses should hire employees for their entire lives. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: There are many advantages and disadvantages to off employee’s job security for life. In Japan, for example, prospective employees know that their employers will provide them with job security for their entire working days and they are better able to plan for their future and family. However, many businesses are now realizing that their employees have less motivation to work and this leads to less profits for the company. I will describe the advantages and disadvantages of this system in this essay and I will show that ultimately “jobs for life” is not good for a society. 
	Job security is very important for both the employee and the employer. For the employee, job security is important because she can depend on her source of income and better plan her future accordingly. For the employer, the employee represents an investment because of the number of hours of training required and the company will continue to have a return on this investment. As we all know, feeling secure about where our future income will come from is very important for our well-being—anybody who has lost a job and has had trouble finding a new one knows that this transition period can cause a lot of anxiety. 
	However, job security tends to lead to decreased productivity. In general, employees who are certain that they can never lose their jobs tend to work less efficiently, thereby contributing to an overall reduction of productivity in the company. A common example all over the world is that of civil servants. In Thailand, for example, many government workers are so indolent that it can take days or months for something to be finished that should only take a few days. It is not uncommon to walk into a government office and see employees filing their nails, making personal calls on the telephone, taking three-hour lunches, or surfing the Internet for fun. 
	Finally, the model of capitalism is proving to be the most efficient model that we have right now. This model of job security completely contradicts the foundations of capitalism. We can see in the United States now that people are starting to change jobs, even careers more and more often. 
	Some career consultants even recommend that employees find new jobs every three to five years. Even in countries that still offer job security for life, this model is showing signs of dying out. For example, in Japan, once famous for its lifelong jobs, both employees and employers are starting to expect that these jobs will not last a lifetime. Many of my Japanese friends travel back and forth between the United States and Japan are have been able to find temporary professional jobs while they are in Japan. 
	In short, I disagree that companies should offer their employees jobs for life. We can see this example in some parts of the world and in other areas in the United States, but these examples are generally regarded as outmoded ways of conducting business. Finally, the models of capitalism, even though it may seem cruel, the so-called “law of the jungle,” are proving to be the most effective way to raise the standard of living of a country.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Should business hire employees for their entire lives? My answer is no. A business has the responsibility to take care of the right and interests of its employees, therefore it should keep them as long as it can. But it is not realistic that a business can hire its employees for their entire lives. 
	Firstly, on the business side, in order to survive and thrive, a business, like a human body, needs to constantly bring in new ideas and fresh minds into the corporation, and eliminate those positions which are not needed any longer. Although this might sound cruel, but it is for the survival of the business. If the business itself cannot continue, every employee will lose his job. People generally think big companies like IBM or Nortel are the kind of place where people can keep their jobs forever, but these days we often hear about the news that these companies also lay off hundreds and thousands of people due to economic situations. 
	Secondly, on the employee side, securing a life-time job in one company is not good for his personal advancement. He tends to be satisfied with his current job, and make no plans for future career advancement. This is harmful for both the company and himself. In fact, it is those hop around among different companies who can get a big increase in terms of salary and benefits, and bring new experiences and skills to their new employee. 
	In conclusion, I think it is not a good idea to hire employees for their entire lives. It is both harmful to business and its employees, and therefore, also harmful to the society.

Topic 35.	Attending or watching on TV? @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Attending a live performance (for example, a play, concert, or sporting event) is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.
Essay 1: Some people like to attend a live performance while others think that watching the same event on television is more enjoyable. To me, I choose watching an event on television because it is easier and not limited and you have choices and can know more details of the event. 
	Watching an event is easier than attending it. You need only a TV set in your room. You do not have to buy a ticket or drive to the place where the event is performed. You can drink some coffee or tea when you want. But if you attend a concert or a play, you have no the freedom to drink or do something else. In addition, you do not need to worry about the traffic jam and being late for the event, so you have light mood to enjoy the event. 
	The other advantage of watching an event on television is that you can enjoy it at any time and you can choose what you like from many channels. But if you attend an event and find you have no interest on it, you would regret and waste time and money. Watching it on television can avoid it. If you are interested in the play, you can stay on it; if you are bored it, you can change the channel to find some interesting. 
	Watching an event on television has another advantage that you can get more details of the event from the interpretation. You can know the background, the present situation and such information of the event. But if you attend it, you cannot learn more knowledge about it. 
	So I choose watching an event on television. I think it is more enjoyable than attending a live performance.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Do you like watching TV? Do you watch it regularly? If a living performance is available what, do you think, will you choose, watching TV or attending the performance? But if I were you I will prefer the latter. 
	Watching TV is boring and exhaustive. Just sitting before the grey box will make you sleepy. You cannot feel the atmosphere in the auditorium which makes the audiences feel refreshed and excited. You can appreciate all the programs through your own eyes not though the square glass screen. 
	There are many other audiences as well as you sitting there and watching the performance which makes you feel accompanied. And you can communicate with others about what you have just seen or thought. This gives you an opportunity to express your opinion. And you know you are not alone then. 
	Going to see the performance out of your house is also good to your body. For you may have a walk after the activity even go to a good bar and find something to drink. You can also see some friends after the show. Though I am not very sure about others I will commonly do such things after a concert. It makes me feel great. 
	So, to take part in a living show is my favorite choice. Instead of watching TV I would like to have some performance publically. It is better than the program in TV I think.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Some people like attending live performance rather than watching the same event on television. They think that will be enjoyable. Others like me, however, do not think so. There are no less than three disadvantages in attending a live performance rendered below: 
	First and foremost, people who will go to a live performance may not see or listen to clearly. Not all seats there are the best place. May be you will feel disappointed after attending it, and you must think the price for ticket is not worth that. 
	There is another factor that deserves some words here. The quality of the performance will depends on some external factors. Suppose that you go to a concert outdoors. Before you leave home, you have to consider how the weather will be go. It is likely that audiences are wet because of rain during the performance. So, even though the performance is in high quality, you may not feel comfortable more or less. 
	In addition, attending a live performance may waste your time. You must go there ahead of time, and you have to park. That will spend much time. 
	I cannot deny that attending a live performance has its own merits. Nonetheless, based on the above discussion, I strongly disagree with the opinion that attending a live performance is more enjoyable.
@Notes: 
Essay 4: I do not agree with the statement that attending a live performance such as a play, concert or sport event is more enjoyable than watching the same event on TV, because there are many disadvantages in attending a real performance. 
	Firstly, there is too much trouble in attending a real performance. You have to buy tickets, sometimes stand in a long queue; you have to plan the trip and set out a few hours before the show started. After arrived at the theatre or stadium, you will have great trouble finding a parking place. During a sport event, your personal safety might be jeopardized: the sports fans might get too excited about the event, and throw bottles. Many people might have heard the news that a girl was killed by a puck during a hockey game. If you take public transport or a taxi home after the show, you might find it very difficult to catch a bus or call a cab. 
	Secondly, the seating arrangement can greatly affect the comfort of seeing the show. If your seat is far from the stage or playground, you can't even see the show clearly. People's heads and cheers will distract you from viewing the show, and in the end you don't even know whom you have seen in a play, or who wins in a sports event! 
	Thirdly, there is no flexibility in a real show. After you have been through so much trouble and eventually start to enjoy the show, you might find that you are quite disappointed about the show after all. Unlike watching TV programs, you neither simply change channels nor leave the theatre in the middle of a concert or play. You might spend a lot of money to suffer from a show that you do not like. 
	On the contrary, watching TV at home, where you can make yourself a cup of coffee, sit back comfortably and relax, watch the show closely, and enjoy the realistic image and sound from your SONY home-theatre system. Besides, you can watch programs whatever you like, and go to bed right when the show has ended. 
	Although many people enjoy the excitement of watch a real show, I think nothing is more convenient and comfortable than watch TV at home.
@Notes: 
Essay 5: To many people, attending a live performance, such as a melodrama, a concert, or a sporting event is so incredibly attractive that they will go all out to get a ticket, regardless of the expense or the difficulty involved. But why not enjoy the performance on television while you can comfortably lie in your sofa or couch with popcorn at hand? That is because attending a live performance provide you with far more enjoyment than watch it on TV. 
	In a live performance, you will feel that you are in the company of many friends who are indulged in the same interest, who can share your sorrow or pleasure or excitement. This kind of resonance at heart is so rarely sensed in our daily life that this one reason itself is sufficient enough for many people to attend a live performance. While watching it on TV, we certainly find it hard to feel the emotion-sharing, and our loneliness is hardly mitigated. 
	Furthermore, attending a live performance gives you a sense of participation which cannot be achieved by watching on TV. Live performance is an intercourse between the audience and the performers, and both parts of the performance decide whether it will be a wonderful one. In this way, you may lament or laugh, may sob or smile as you are so influenced by the misfortune or happiness of the characters. You may fall into the indescribable intoxication while listen to a favorite piece of music. And correspondingly, the performers will receive the response of their audience and act accordingly. So the final success of the performance results also from the participation and interaction of the audience, of which you are a member. 
	With these foregone advantages, we may say that attending the live performance is definitely much more enjoyable than TV watching.

Topic 36.	One vehicle has changed people's lives @Choose one of the following transportation vehicles and explain why you think it has changed people's lives: automobiles, bicycles, airplanes. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: An airplane is a form of transportation that has changed people's lives. Thanks to the plane, our lives are now faster, more exciting, and more convenient that before. 
	You cannot deny that a plane is fast. For example, the Concorde flies at supersonic speed. A businessman can leave Paris at 11 a.m. in the morning and arrive in New York at 8 a.m. the same morning in time for a day's work. Many business people in Europe will fly to London for a noon meeting and then return home to Rome or Madrid for dinner. 
	It is always exciting to take a plane trip. When you take a trip by plane, you know that you might cross many time zones, many oceans, and many countries. When you get off the plane, you could be in a place that speaks a different language. A plane is like a magician's trick. You get in a box and you come out somewhere totally different. 
	Nothing can beat the convenience of a plane. In the old days, it might take you days to do what the plane can do it an hour. Boats, for example, only leave on certain days of the week and take a long time to get to their destination. Planes give you the option to leave several times a day and get you to your destination quickly. 
	Although other forms of transportation may be more comfortable, none has changed the way we do business and live our lives more than the plane. Thanks to the speed, excitement, and convenience of the planes, our lives are richer.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: The modern society have been changed by the enormous impact of the invention of the transportation, such as the automobile, which has become indispensable in the daily live. The automobiles are so popular that almost every family or even everyone has one. Since the function and effect of automobile is known by everyone. In this essay, I would discuss another invention of the transportation that is as important as the automobile in the modern society, the plane. As far as I am concerned, these are three conspicuous aspects as follows. 
	The main reason for my propensity to choose plane is that plane is the vehicle used by people most frequently. Usually, people drive car in short way, while they take plane in long travel. The most important reason people choose it for long distance is that the speed of plane is much faster than others. The invention of plane create a completely new live. Nowadays, we can travel around the earth within twenty-four hours, that is something say we can reach any place of the word in one day. And there are many people who live in a place and work in the other city even the other nation, for the plane can bring them go home in weekend. 
	Another reason can be seen by every person is that plane is known as one of the most safe and convenient vehicles. It is reported from the relative data that the accident ratio of the plane is far under that of the train, the ship, the automobile and any other else. With the development of the hi-tech, faster, safer and more comfortable plane are made. Since the supersonic plane appears, both speed and security rapidly improve. Furthermore, new type plane provide various of the equipment to alleviate the fatigue of the passengers and improve the degree of comfort. 
	In addition, the charge for taking plane is affordable to common person. Similar to the most family can take enough money to buy a car, most people have enough money to buy a ticket of plane. 
	Especially, there are so many discounts for students, old men and children by the airline company. 
	General speaking, the new technology has brought many invention to us in the modern society. Taking into account of all these things, we may reach the conclusion that as an important transportation vehicle the plane changes our daily live and at the same time brings the enormous influence to the modern society.

Topic 37.	Is progress always good? @Do you agree or disagree that progress is always good? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: Who would disagree with the statement "progress is good"? Without progress, there would be no change. Without progress, there would be no change in our economy, our standard of living, or our health. 
	Progress is required to keep the economy moving forward. New products need to be developed; new services need to be created. Without progress, our economy would standstill. There would be no change. Without progress, there would be no supermarkets with fresh produce brought in from all over the world. 
	Progress is required to improve our standard of living. Our homes today are more efficient and use less natural resources thanks to improvement in home construction techniques. Our clothes are warmer and safer thanks to developments in textile manufacturing. Our educational system is better thanks to the use of the computers and the Internet. 
	Progress is required to improve the health of the world population. Without progress, there would be no vaccines against deadly diseases like smallpox. Without progress, there would be increased infant mortality. Thanks to progress, our lives are longer and healthier. 
	Progress is a natural state. Without it, we would not evolve. Without it, our economy, our standard of living, and our health would deteriorate. Who could deny the necessity of progress?
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Is progress always good? Scientific progress brings us many conveniences and advanced machines, such as computers, automobiles, and so on. Progress seems to have made life simpler and more comfortable. But if we analyze it carefully, we will find that progress is not always good. 
	Modern industry brings us more convenient life. But at the same time, some problems appear. For example, "the green-house effect" is a very serious problem that scientists try to solve it as early as possible. It increases the earth temperature and some icebergs melt and the sea level becomes higher and higher gradually. Maybe someday the sea will swallow some big cities nearby the sea. 
	Progress enhances the product efficiency, but it also brings us another serious problem-pollution. 
	Pollution is so serious that ecological balance is damaged and many animals and plants lose their living environment and become extinct eventually. The air is polluted and it is not suitable for people. The water is also polluted and people are facing deficiency of drinking water in some countries. 
	Progress makes the speed of life faster and faster because of the usage of computers and automatic machines. People have to work faster than before and it makes them nervous. More and more physical and psychological problems disturb people's life. Many people do not have time for recreation. 
	From the above statements, it can be concluded that progress is not always good. It has its own negative influences on our life. Maybe those problems can be solved by more progress.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: All over the world people are welcoming progress into their home, their business and their education. Large corporations use progress in technology, industries use progress in their manufacture process. However, when we think about in larger picture, it is clear that progress can be damaging in some cases. We as a society have to check ourselves once and a while to make sure, that the progress is not making too much damage to certain communities around the world. 
	Speaking as a member of a very special community called a Kibbutz, which used to provide to our people from the agriculture products we grow in our own fields, and sell in markets. When progress came to our country, many industries got stronger, and farmers like ourselves found themselves without a future for their agriculture investment, that they worked and built for years. In this case progress has damaged a large community, and made them face a hard financial future. 
	Another unfortunate view on progress, is the use of computers to entertain children. In the year 2000, when every home has adopted the progress in computers, children find themselves sitting long hours in front of the computer instead of playing outside or inviting friends over. This way of spending too much time on the computer is very damaging to their social skills, and even a reason for weight gain among young children. 
	After looking at a different aspects of progress, I can say clearly, that progress has to be supervised. That in some cases progress is making a big damage for our society. People should welcome progress in many fields of life, but always have your eyes open for little "land mines" that could make an irreversible situation and future.
@Notes: 
Essay 4: The nobleness & the use of progress in any field, to an individual, or to the society on the whole, will depend on what use the progress is being put to, and I feel, cannot be generalized as stated above. 
	Progress has been inherent with the human race. As the human brain developed, so has progress been achieved, in almost all fields known to man? The cultural progress over the ages, have made humans better and made this world, a better place to live in. Similarly, scientific progress has been effective in eradicating diseases, providing better food crops, facilitating transportation etc. Literary progress has helped us better document our history and has produced works that have made us think. Progress in communication techniques have converged this whole world of ours, into the 'global village'. 
	If we look at the above examples, we see that they are all aimed at the betterment of our world. Here progress is being applied for the society's good. 
	The products from the same progress in the various fields, when in wrong hands, wreak havoc in the same society that they are supposed to make better. 
	Sophisticated arms & explosives in the hands of terrorists & children, science of human cloning in the hands of scientists, crop control technologies in the hands of corporations etc., are some of the examples of how progress can go wrong. Think of how much better the world would be, without nuclear and biological weapons, without mutated food grains et al. Think of how many people would not have died or maimed for life, if there had been no land mines? After witnessing the destructive use the Dynamite could be put to, Alfred Nobel himself repented his own creation of Dynamite so much that he set up the Nobel Prize, to be awarded to people who work for the betterment of the human society. 
	Therefore, it is my strong contention that progress is only good when it is put to the right use, for the betterment and uplift of the individual and the society, on a whole. Progress put to any ulterior uses should be outright condemned.

Topic 38.	Value by learning about the past @Learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: I disagree wholeheartedly that learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present. In fact, the definition of learning includes the idea of an accumulation of experiences from the past. Learning can only take place if we make an association between things that have happened in the past or between something in the past and something that we predict will happen in the future. All knowledge that we acquire as we grow is from the past-language, customs, academic subjects, and so on. While it may be helpful sometimes to be able to overlook previous knowledge in order to avoid the constraint conformity, the vast majority of knowledge that we learn is a huge boost-imagine if each of us had to discover by ourselves that 2 + 2 = 4! So, in a very real sense, all learning depends on past events. 
	We are only able to live in this world with our current standard of living because we have learned from the past. We receive knowledge from the past and we are able to use it and improve it. We examine our actions in the past and we make judgments about what was right and what was wrong. Then, it is hoped, we will attempt to avoid those same mistakes again. For example, one of the great mistakes all over the world has been depriving women and the disempowered classes’ status in society and many industrialized and developing countries all over the world are attempting to avoid such mistakes both in the present and in the future. 
	Furthermore, all of the knowledge that we have today is a result of all the work of our predecessors. The ancient Greeks developed geometry, which helped other European scientists analyze the solar system, which in turn gave us a new understanding of our place in the universe. The great majority of technology today depends directly on several thousands of years of work of past thinkers. To ignore the knowledge of the past would be to throw away five thousand years of history and experience. 
	There is, however, some seemingly small, but important value to ignoring the past. It is often the case that history or tradition has the effect of constraining our thought in the present and many important philosophical and scientific breakthroughs have only been possible as a direct result of ignoring the past. The past, in a sense, can blind us to the truth, we can become bound by tradition. For example, at one time, leading thinkers in Europe thought that the Earth was at the center of the universe and those who disagreed were persecuted as heretics, even Copernicus, who we now know was correct about his heliocentric model of the Solar System. However, scientists were eventually able to break from the past and accept the new model of the universe. 
	In short, learning from and analyzing the past has enormous value for us and life as we know it on Earth today would not be possible without the benefit of thousands of years of history and accumulated knowledge. It is important, however, to ignore the past so that we can make a step forward, and such free thinking should be encouraged, although not at the expense of past knowledge. Learning from the past is something like learning from our parents-in most cases, their past helps us have a better future, but there are times when we need to make a break from the past and make a bold step into an unknown future.

Topic 39.	Is technology helping students? @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? With the help of technology, students nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: Technology has greatly improved the way we get information. Students can now get more information, get it more quickly, and get it more conveniently. 
	The Internet and the World Wide Web has opened every major library and database to students around the world. Information comes not only in print form, but also in multimedia. You can get audio and video data. You can get information about events in the past as well as events that unfold as you watch your computer monitor. 
	Information comes at the speed of the Internet which is to say in nanoseconds? You can type in a few key words in your search engine, and the engine will search the entire WWW to find information on your topic. You don't have to spend hours pouring over card catalogs in the library and looking at the shelves. This research is done for you instantly on the Web. 
	It is certainly more convenient to sit at home and do research on your computer. Your computer is open 24-hours a day, unlike a library or office which has limited hours and limited resources. You can do research in your pajamas while you eat breakfast. What could be more convenient? 
	Technology, especially the Internet, has certainly changed the quantity and quality of the information we get. The speed and convenience of a computer helps students learn more, more quickly.

Topic 40.	The expression "Never give up" @The expression "Never, never give up" means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: I do strongly support the idea that we should keep trying and never stop working for our goals. I think this is the most important thing that can help us to achieve our goals. I believe that everybody meets many obstacles in their lives before achieving their goals. I have learned the biography of some famous people in the past. I found that almost all of them persevered through enormous hardships in order to reach their goals. In this essay, I will give you an example of the attempt of a great inventor of the world named Thomas Edison. 
	I am quite sure that everybody knows Thomas Edison. He made many inventions during his lifetime. According to his biography, it states that he always met obstacles in order to invent something. However, he still kept trying in order to meet his goals. I personally think that this is the most important thing that made him reach his goals. Some scientists said that it was impossible to invent something such as electric light and movie projector. However, he could make them success. In my opinion, the greatest invention of Edison was electric light. I have learned that he got many hardships and failures, but he never gave up. He spent about two years to achieve it. He used to say that his successes came from hardworking more than luck or fate. 
	In conclusion, I believe that everyone cannot achieve their goals if they always give up when they meet the obstacles and hardships. I think that we have to try to solve the problems we will meet. I am quite sure that we can do everything success if we are confident that we can do it and never give it up.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: "Never, never give up" means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. I think it's a very good piece of advice for all of us. 
	Never stop working for your goals doesn't mean you must be successful; it doesn't even mean that you must achieve your goal, but it's very important to keep it in your mind. 
	You want to be a great basketball player, but you are 1,60m tall; you want to be a great pianist, but what you have studied in the university was physics; you want to establish your own company, but you are just a clerk in a small company. These examples are very common in our real lives. 
	There are enough unfavorable conditions which make our lives difficult, but what important for us is to make efforts towards your goal or your dream. If you have given your best for your goal or your dream, whether you succeed or not, at least you won't leave any regret in your life. What's more, who knows, what will happen in the next 10 years? 
	You might not be a famous basketball player, but you could become a good player in the basketball-team of your school. You might not be a great pianist, but you play the piano very well and enjoy yourself after the heavy work every day. You might not be able to establish your own company yet, but you are just collecting experience and knowledge as a good manager, and maybe in 10 years, you will become the boss of your own company. 
	Few of us have perfect lives, what I want to say is, don't give up working for your goal or your dream. If you succeed, you will taste great joy in your life. If you don't succeed, you won't have regret in your life because you have given your best. Besides, in trying to achieve your goals, you might find out that perhaps your goals are not correct or not practical at all, then you can improve them and make your life more beautiful.

Topic 41.	Using and saving land @Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree with this point of view? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: In the past, there have been many endangered animals. Now they are extinct. Does it matter? Has our environment been affected by their absence? Has the quality of our own life been changed? The answer to these questions is "Yes." 
	It does matter if we destroy an endangered species habitat to develop more farmland, housing or industrial parks. There is a delicate balance of nature. If one small part is removed, it will affect all the other parts. For example, if certain trees are cut down, bats will have no place to roost. If they cannot roost, they cannot breed. If there are no bats, there will be no animal, or bird to eat certain insects that plague our crops. 
	Our environment has been affected by the absence of certain animals. Certain flowers are pollinated by butterflies which migrate from Canada to Mexico. Some of the breeding grounds of these butterflies were destroyed. Now these flowers are disappearing from certain areas. We will no longer be able to enjoy their beauty. 
	The quality of our life has been changed. America used to be covered with giant trees. Now we have to visit them in one small park. Rainforests around the world are being cut down to make room for humans. We will never be able to see or study this fragile ecosystem. 
	I would encourage us humans to look for other alternatives for our farmlands, housing, and industries. We have alternatives; the animals do not.

Topic 42.	An important skill to be successful @What is a very important skill a person should learn in order to be successful in the world today? Choose one skill and use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.
Essay 1: Upon the question that what is the very important skill a person should learn in the world today, different people have different opinions. In my point of view, I prefer to think that communication is the most important skill for almost every person. There are many reasons to support my view. 
	Firstly, communication is a bridge between people. Nobody is omnipotent; people depend on one another in their daily lives. We all hope we can be become the person who masters every skills and can complete every kind work by ourselves. However the real world tells us that this just is a dream. Therefore, people are interdependent, no one can say that he does not need other people's help. The society requires cooperation among people. Communication is the link. Communication is the first step of successful cooperation among people. By communication, we exchange of thoughts and information, and get other people understand our needs and ideas. For example, in a company, big or small, a manager always has to communicate with his boss, colleagues and subordinates. 
	Secondly, communication can help us keep friendship and make new friends. Friends need to communicate to each other, so that they know each other's needs and feelings. Indeed, the most important qualities of a friend is communication and understanding. If you are a good communicator, it is very easy for you to keep your friendship and make new friends. If you do not communicate with your friends, you will not only feel lonely, but also can eventually loss your friends. 
	From all above, I think that communication is the most important skill for people to survive in this society. I hope everybody works hard to get the skill.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Nowadays people say that we have stepped into "The Information Age", therefore computer skills are one of the most important skills in today's society. Being able to operate a computer is an advanced technique and can increase one’s work efficiency and simplify many works. Using a computer can help people do many complex works. You can calculate a very complex arithmetic problem. Many arithmetic problems in engineering are too complex to work out by hands. A computer can do these works conveniently and easily. You can also look for some references from a foreign country from a computer if you login in the Internet. You can save your documents in some discs on a computer no matter how large they are and you do not need to take a lot of paper. 
	Using a computer can increase your work efficiency. With its help, you can book plane tickets and hotel rooms for a business trip. You can easily compile your files in a shorter time and retrieve them whenever you need. If you are an engineer, you can control machines automatically with the help of a computer. The products are more precise than those controlled by hands and the product efficiency is higher. You can save a lot of time to consider other things and this is important for your success. 
	If you can operate a computer, you can sit down in your own home and control distant work. All you need to do is pressing some keys. With the help of a computer, your work can be simplified. You also can use a computer to communicate with your friends by e-mails and it is quicker and safer than ordinary means. 
	There are many other skills a person should learn to be successful, but I think that being able to operating a computer is the most important.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: With the development of science and technology, the world is no longer what it used to be. Everyone should master one or more skills in order to survive and succeed in the world. As far as I am concerned, the most important skill one should learn is to teach himself or herself. 
	To begin with, no one can depend on a teacher in the whole life. In high school and university, several teachers can teach you physics, chemistry, biology and so on. But when you find a job and leave school, few people will tell you how to solve the problem you encounter in the job. What you can do is to read books and find the answers yourself. If you do not have the ability to teach yourself, it is difficult to survive in the world. 
	In addition, what we have learned in the school is probably not enough. Nowadays new science and technology develop very rapidly. Suppose you are majored in computer. As we all know, the computer science is changing fast. New idea and concept may appear everyday. Once you stop studying, you may probably leave behind and even lose your job. 
	Last but not least, keeping studying can lead you to a high salary job. If you understand the most advanced knowledge, lots of companies may hire you, because the more science one can master, the higher productivity he will have. Do you have a dream to have a good job? If you do, learn how to teach yourself right now. 
	So from what has been discussed, one can reach only this conclusion that teaching himself or herself is a very important skill a person should learn in order to be successful in the world today.
@Notes: 
Essay 4: Two years ago, if you ask a person what do they think is the most important skill to be successful in the world, you will get a variety of answers. If you ask a person who is about my age the same question, presumably, eight out of ten will give the same answer as mine-computer skill is the most important skill a person should learn. 
	Why I think computer skill is the most important skill? First, computer skills such as operating a word processing software package or typing are convenient and efficient. For example, I am writing this essay by using a computer. If I do not have computer skill, I cannot make a composition as quickly as possible; maybe I can only write on paper. Another vivid example is that many colleges is offering online classes for student to choose, which means the students can study in the comfort of their homes and acquire their knowledge by means of using computer at home. 
	Secondly, computers is an important tool for teaching and communicating between teachers and students. Recently, school teachers have an increasingly demand on students to turning in their papers or school works, and the teachers can score on line. If the teacher has an assignment, they just send an e-mail to the students. In addition, many young people use computers to communicate with each other. They use online chat rooms, ICQs and messengers. They even play online games through the internet. Therefore computer skills are important for students to communicate with their teachers and fellow students. 
	Last but not least, computer skill help a person to find a good job after they graduate. As we open newspapers and search for a good job, we can find that computer skill is a required skill for nearly every job. Indeed, whether you work as a receptionist, salesperson, warehouse manager and office clerk, you have to operate a computer and therefore computer skills is absolutely necessary for these jobs and most others. 
	Although there are many other important skills for a person to succeed in today's world, judging from what I have mentioned above, I think my point of view is solid and sound. Having computer skills is one of the most important thing in today's world.
@Notes: 
Essay 5: The one skill I would choose for success is tolerance. I do not define success economically; I define success socially. To succeed in the future, we will need to be tolerant of one another's background, opinions, and lifestyle. 
	The world is becoming increasingly mobile. We no longer are able to live and work only with people who went to the same schools and went to the same parties as our parents and we did. Now, we will work directly with people whose backgrounds are completely different from ours. We must be tolerant of these differences as they must be tolerant of us if we are to live and work together amiably. 
	We cannot stop speaking to people or start a war just because there is a difference in opinion. We must learn to be tolerant of one another and respect these differences in opinion. We have to find a common ground, an idea we can both agree on. Once we have agreement on one subject, it will be easier to settle differences in other subjects. 
	Different people have different lifestyles. We must accept these differences even though they may be different than what we are used to. Women can live on their own, hold important jobs, and raise children on their own. Men can stay home and take care of children. Social roles can change and we must be tolerant of these changes. 
	To succeed socially, you must get use to varieties. You must be tolerant of all peoples regardless of their background, their opinions, or their lifestyles.

Topic 43.	People and dangerous sports @Why do you think some people are attracted to dangerous sports or other dangerous activities? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: Have you experienced the fear of bungee jumping? Have you ever enjoyed the excitement of car racing? Nowadays, more and more people are attracted to such dangerous activities, especially the young people. Wondering why? After thinking about the lifestyle of those people, the reason goes as follows. 
	While the world is becoming more and more competitive, the task on each person’s shoulder becomes heavier and heavier. People’s activity everyday is very intense and they get more and more burdened after days of hard work. So everyone wants a release and the best way to relax and get relieved is to do the dangerous activities, because while you are doing something dangerous, you have to be concentrated on it, and you can’t think about anything else. Hence you relieved all the unhappiness and the troubles you had in daily work. 
	In addition, to take risks and try out new things is one of human being’s basic instincts. People always like to do something new, especially when something is popular as well. According to some statistics, the dangerous activities are becoming extremely popular among young people. If you don’t try some dangerous activities, people will think that you are a coward and afraid of doing it. So it’s reasonable enough for them to do dangerous activities to show their braveness. 
	However, I don’t like dangerous activities and I believe the phenomenon that people are attracted to dangerous activities is just a whim. After realizing countless disadvantages of them, people will reconsider about them. Some safer activities to help people to get relieved will be developed afterwards.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Dangerous sports or activities attract a certain type of person. This person is often a risk taker, an optimist, and a fatalist. 
	People who take risks are found both in dangerous sports and business. But it is a special person who takes a risk with his own life as opposed to his money. My father was a risk taker. He put everything he owned into his business, but he stopped playing risky sports like horseback riding and skiing. Once his business was a success and he no longer had to worry about providing for us, he returned, at the age of 60, to the risky sports that he did as a youth. 
	Someone who plays dangerous sports must be an optimist. They cannot imagine that anything will happen to them. They never think about breaking their leg while skiing, falling off a cliff while rock climbing, fatting on their head while sky diving. They live for the thrill of the moment without a thought to the many things that could go wrong. 
	Rock climbers and sports car drivers must be fatalist. They might plan for potential problems, but once they have done everything they can do, the outcome is out of their hands. A motorcyclist who jumps across a narrow canyon will get the fastest, strongest bike available that will carry him or her across the canyon. However, wind conditions or other problems might interfere and the cyclist may fall short of his goal. 
	Many people have the same traits of course. Many of us are risk takers, optimists, and fatalists. But I think people who play dangerous sports must have these characteristics in abundance.

Topic 44.	Traveling alone or with a companion? @Some people like to travel with a companion. Other people prefer to travel alone. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.
Essay 1: Traveling is a very pleasant thing. Some people like to travel with several friends. Other people, however, would prefer to travel alone. Each way has its advantages. As far as I am concerned, traveling with my friends is my choice. 
	Why do some people like to travel just himself or herself? For one thing, they have more freedom. They do not need to discuss the routine with others. What he or she wants to go, just go? For another, they can have more relax. They do not need to keep an eye on how to get along with friends. 
	Although there may be one or more advantages to traveling alone, I insist that traveling with friends far overweigh them. In the first place, you can make the trip easy. Traveling is not a very easy activity. For example, you need to find transportation tools, hotel and restaurant in strange places. Several friends can average these tasks so that such things will not bother every one much and enjoy the journey more. 
	In the second place, you can get help when you need. There will be many unexpected surprising thing during the journey. Such as, get lost, be sick, cannot wake up early for the morning flight. It is very tough for people to handle these situations by themselves especially when they travel to a strange place. Friends can give you a hand to overcome all these difficulties. As a Chinese slang says, "everyone needs the help from others." 
	In addition, you can have more fun. Enjoying the scene spots is wonderful, while traveling on the road is boring. How to spend this boring time? Talking with friends, playing cards will help you out. 
	In conclusion, I prefer to travel with friends rather than travel alone not only because the trip will be easier with friends, but also because more help and fun will be got from friends.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: I prefer to travel with a companion. 
	First, you can save plenty of time and money. In the travel, you have lots of things must do except see landscape such as booking hotel, buying tickets, looking for bus stations etc. If you have a companion can do these things with you, you will have more time to see landscape and to rest. It's the most important that you will have a good mood rather than be upset by those small beer. Money is a very big problem. If you like to travel alone, you must afford all. But if you have a companion, you can save money in transport, hotel, even tickets. That may let you travel more days than you plan. 
	Time and money is important to you, but when you have trouble what you want is sincerely help. 
	I like climbing mountain. I have been to the Jiuzhaigou in the Sichuan province. It is very beautiful place, but it locates high altitude. We meet big trouble of breath when we climbed mountain. In the way, my friend and I had a turn on carrying bags and helping each other when we felt tired. When we reached the mountain peak, we embraced. We all knew the one thing that if you have no help from your friend, you cannot reach the peak. 
	In most of time, you may get funs from your friend. When you want to get a photo, your friend can take a picture for you. When you feel scared, your friend can encourage you. When you are lonely, your friend can joke you. When you get a beautiful place, you can share your happiness, inspiration with your friend. 
	A companion can bring some help, save time and money; also you can feel human's spirit in the same time. Your eyes not only see nice landscape of nature, but the beautiful landscape of human beings.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Traveling alone is the only way to travel. If you take someone with you, you take your home with you. When you travel alone, you meet new people, have new experiences, and learn more about yourself. 
	When I travel with a friend, I spend all my time with that friend. We eat together and sightsee together. When I travel alone, I spend my time looking for new friends. It is easy to find other people, either other tourists or locals, to eat with or have a coffee with. When you share meals with strangers, they become friends. 
	When I travel with a friend, my routine is predictable. We maintain the same schedule that we do at home. When I travel alone, I adopt the rhythm of the place I visit. I might take a nap in the afternoon and eat dinner at 11 pm. I might go to a disco and dance all night. 
	When I travel with a friend, we know how we will react to things. When I travel alone, each new experience requires a new reaction. If I don't try new things, I won't be able to decide if I like something or not. Shall I ride an ostrich or eat one? 
	I think it is always important to do things on your own. You can find new friends, collect new memories, and adopt different ways of doing things. Isn't that the point of travel?
@Notes: 
Topic 45.	Time to wake up and start the work @Some people prefer to get up early in the morning and start the day's work. Others prefer to get up later in the day and work until late at night. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.
Essay 1: Some people prefer to get up early in the morning and start the day’s work. Others, however, prefer to get up later in the day and work until late at night. As far as I am concerned, getting up early is a good habit because it is good for health and is easy to take care of everyday works. 
	In the first place, everyone knows that getting up early is a very good habit for our health. You can enjoy the fresh air in the early morning, and also you can get a good night sleep during the quiet midnight time. Moreover, if you get up early, before go to work, you still have enough time to do some exercises, such as walking, running and riding the bike. Without doubt, all of the exercises do help your health. 
	In the second place, it is a little bit easy to take care of everyday works if people get up early. For example, if everyone in the family gets up early, wife will have enough time to prepare the breakfast for the whole family, children will have enough time to catch the school bus, husband will never forget to change his dirty shirt. Everything is on the order. 
	Admittedly, some people who work until midnight and get up later in the day claim that working in the midnight is more efficient and can concentrate the work without distraction. However, the advantages of getting up early carry more weight than those of getting up later. 
	To sum up, from what I have discussed above, we can safely draw a conclusion that getting up early can benefit not only because it is good for ours health but also it is easy for us to take care of everyday works. Therefore, I prefer to get up early in the morning and start the day's work.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Some people prefer to get up early in the morning to start the day's work; while other people like to get up later in the day to work until late at night. Which option do you prefer? I would choose to get up early in the morning. This view is based on the following reasons. 
	By getting up early in the morning you can enjoy a lot of good things that nature offers. You can breathe fresh air, smell aroma of flowers, and listen the birds singing in the morning. What a beautiful world! In the meantime, these can refresh our brains and quickly get ready for the day's work. We can immediately concentrate in the work, and solve the problems with great efficiency. For example, when I was in senior middle school, I got up early in the morning everyday to go over my lessons and prepare the courses that I would have that day. I found it was so efficient and I memorized my study material so deeply. On the contrary, people who get up late and go to bed late tend to leave all the day's work to the night, and tend to go to bed until the finish the day's work. This is not a good living habit and also not an efficiently way of working. 
	Another reason why I would like to get up early to start a day's work is because I believe that it is good for our health. The body's cycle follows the nature: when the sun rise, it is time to get up; when the moon rise, it is time to go to bed. Besides, by getting up early we can have time to do some exercises such as jogging, hiking and swimming, which will benefit our health. Many statistics show that most people who live a long life get up early and go to bed early. While getting up late and go to bed late violates human biology and therefore will do harm to the health. And people who get up late never got a chance to do morning exercises. 
	In a word, getting up early in the morning to start a day's work is a smart choice for people, it can benefit both people's work and health.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: I prefer sleeping late and staying up late at night. This routine fits my body's rhythm, my work schedule, and my social life. 
	I believe in following my body's natural rhythm. My body tells me to sleep until I am ready to get up and go to bed when I am sleepy. This means I never get up early in the morning. My body tells me it likes me to get 8 to 10 hours of sleep a day. 
	Sleeping late also fits my work schedule. Actually I don't have that much work to do. I can easily finish my work between lunch and dinner. I think that if one works too much, there is not enough time left to enjoy one's self. 
	My active social life is another reason I prefer to sleep late. Who gets up early in the morning to have fun? No one. Anything amusing, such as concerts, dances, parties, dinners, all happen at night. If I got up early in the morning, I would be too tired to enjoy myself in the evening. 
	I will maintain this pattern forever I hope. I think it is always important to listen to your body and if your body tells you to stay in bed, you should listen to it. By listening to your body, you will never let work interfere with your social life.
@Notes: 
Topic 46.	Good son and daughter @What are the important qualities of a good son or daughter? Have these qualities changed or remained the same over time in your culture? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: The qualities of a good son and daughter-obedience, loyalty, respect-have not changed. Any parent will tell you that, like their ancestors, they expect these qualities from their children. However, they do not always get what they expect from their children. 
	Parents demand that their sons and daughters, regardless of age, obey them. Even if the children are married and have their own children, they should still do whatever their parents ask of them. At least, that's the way it was. Now, children tend to obey their parents until the children are of college age. Then they feel they are adult enough and can make their own decisions even if these decisions are against the parent's wishes. 
	Parents also expect loyalty from their children. If there was a dispute in the neighborhood or between families, the parents would expect their children to side with their own family. This quality is probably still very common. Most children today will support their family against others. 
	Parents, of course, demand respect. As people become more mobile, and children are introduced to non-traditional ways of doing things, this quality may not endure. Parents are sometimes viewed as old-fashioned. Children don't think their parents can appreciate the way life really is. They think their parents are too old to understand. They lose respect for their parents. 
	Obedience, loyalty, and respect are virtues that are being challenged today. We may not obey our parent, give them the loyalty or respect they wish or deserve, but I hope my children obey me, are loyal to me, and respect me.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: When asked about the important qualities of a good son or daughter, people have all kind of views concerning it. From my point of view, the important qualities of a good son or daughter consist of listening to the right advice from parents, taking care of parents when growing up and respecting them. 
	The most important quality, I think, is that we should respect our parents. It was our parents who brought us into the world and brought us up. They provided us food and clothes, and send us to school to study knowledge. They tried their bests to make our life happy and comfortable. Accordingly, it was our responsibility to respect our parents, including their labor and opinions. We should not spend too much money on useless things because it comes from parents’ labor. At the same time, we must listen to the right advice from parents and don’t act according to our own wishes and desires despite the objection of parents. 
	The second quality for a good son is that we should care for our parents when we grow up. Nowadays we have already attended the university, usually far away from parents. So we should keep in touch with them by telephone, letter and e-mail, not making them feel lonely. We may talk about their life at home, such as their work and their health. In fact every time when I give a call to my parents, I may feel that they are very happy because of the telephone. The reason is that not only can the get the information about me, but also they know that their son concerns himself with his parents. 
	A good son should have many merits. From my point of view, respecting the parents and caring for them are the most important for everyone. What’s more, they can’t be changed with the development of the society because they are the fundamental qualities for a good son or daughter.
@Notes: 
Topic 47.	A large or a small company @Some people prefer to work for a large company. Others prefer to work for a small company. Which would you prefer? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.
Essay 1: No doubt, I choose to work for a small company because there are too many benefits that outnumber its disadvantages not to choose. But working for a large company has advantages no more than its disadvantages. 
	The most important benefit of working for a small company is that I will have many chances to develop. In general, a small company is a developing enterprise and it is not easy to absorb many excellent employees. If I enter this small company, I think that the boss will appreciate me and give me many opportunities to reveal my abilities. Only I let the job do well, I am sure that I will rise very rapidly. 
	On contrary to this, a large company is already a high developed institutions. There are many prominent talent working for it. A good position will absorb hundreds of opponents. It will take me a lot of time and vigor to get this position. Maybe I have no chance to win this competition at all. 
	Another benefit of working for a small company, which working for a large company almost cannot achieve, is that I can learn more skills in a small company than in a large company. As shown above, a small company is a developing enterprise. This means that it have no a great deal of money to employ many persons. So, I can do all kinds of jobs at the same time. I think that this will be useful to compete in the society. But in a large company, maybe I only engage a monotonous job over a long period of time. I believe that this will be helpless to improve my capacity. 
	Of course, choosing to work for a large company also has advantages to some extent. For example, it will afford handsome salary and will be not easy to fail in business competition. But from my own development, I still want to work in a small company. In addition, I believe that every large company originates from a small company. Maybe I will become an important person when the small company in which I work become a large company.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: I would prefer to work in a large company rather than a small one. A large company has more to offer in terms of advancement, training, and prestige. 
	In a large company, lean start at an entry-level position and work myself up to the top. I could start in the mailroom and, once I know the company, can apply for a managerial position. In a small company, there is not as much room to grow. 
	In a large company, there are a variety of jobs. I could work in sales, in marketing, in distribution, in shipping, or in any department I applied for. I could be trained in a variety of positions and would have valuable experience. In a small company, there would not be the same opportunity. 
	In a large company, there would be more prestige. I could brag to my friends that I worked for one of the biggest companies in the world. I would always have something to talk about when I met strangers. If I worked for a small company, I would always have to explain what the company did. 
	Working for a small company would -not give me the same opportunities for advancement or on the job training as working for a larger company would. Nor would I be as proud to work for a small company-unless the small company was my own.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Some people show special interest in working for a big company, while other are more willing to work for small ones! Of course, every individual has his own opinion about the strengths and weakness when it comes to serving in a big firm or a small one; for me, my choice is definitely to work for a big company! 
	Now let's use the analysis of "SWOT", which was always employed in the field of economics to get the above-said problem solved! Here, S stands for "strengths", W for "weakness", O for "opportunities" and T for "target"! 
	Working for a big company will have many aspects of strengths for your development in your career, because, in my head, a big company usually provides more competitiveness and it demands its employees to be self-educated at the very beginning of becoming one member of the group or he or she will be dismissed without hesitation, for as a big company, there are always a pool of talents waiting for the position which he or she occupied before! Besides, in a big company, you will deal with shades of people, who are maybe from different provinces or even different countries, having various education, as well as family background, and so on, in such way you will be inevitably influenced by "multi-culture", regardless of the various cultures of different provinces, or of different nations, which is of great importance for a person with the hope of tailoring himself to be an international talent. Finally, in a big company you will be given more opportunities to be charged up in your free time either at home or abroad and be endowed with more chances to contact with more elites in the specific field or other fields. 
	When speaking of the weakness, in my humble opinion, of course, everything is a double-edged sword, working for a big company might have little chance for those who have little of parts to get out due to the bulk of talents, but compared with strengths and the opportunities mentioned above, it can be omitted, to put it exceedingly! 
	When it comes to the target, you, as a member of a big company, you will be more likely to motorize your target because of the plentiful resources including material resources, as well as human resources. 
	All that I have said above boils down to the conclusion that if you are a person who craves for competitiveness and desires to be an international or Inter-provincial talent, you should choose the big firms for your future development.
@Notes: 
Topic 48.	Why do people work? @People work because they need money to live. What are some other reasons that people work? Discuss one or more of these reasons. Use specific examples and details to support your answer.
Essay 1: In modern society, work has already been a necessary means by which all the people live in the world, in spite of a few exceptions. First of all, people must work in order to get the money to meet their living. Besides, there are some more reasons that are also important for people's working, of which making continuous progress is what I mostly want to emphasize. 
	As we all know, the human being is an animal greatly more advanced than, and greatly different in many aspects from, other common animals in the world such as cats, horses, oranges and so on. So feeding is not the only aim that people live for, as is said in a Chinese saying, “human beings are not living for only living.” People also need to make continuous progress personally in the modern and continually changing world. And all kinds of work give people one of the most effective ways to make progress, which can be illustrated by some reasons below. 
	First of all, people can learn varieties of basic knowledge and abilities that they need to deal with all kinds of problems they may meet in study, life, or work in current society. All the abilities, except for those physiological functions, people need to live in the world are not innately, of which family and school could supply only a small part, and most of them must be given by work. 
	For example, proper relationship in work is the basic warranty of your working successfully. While in work, you would learn how to deal with the relationship between you and your leaders of your company, if you are an ordinary employee, or the relationship between you and your followings if you are a director mastering the company. Furthermore, this rule can surely also be used when you affiliate with other people you meet in society. 
	Besides, on the way of making continuous progress, people usually can't control themselves correctly by themselves in two basic aspects: the direction and motivation of progress. However, in the course of work, people will not lost their basic direction according to the daily task given to them. As the same time, once you have a fresh task that can interest you, you also will process the motivation to finish it, which keep you making progress in your life. 
	In a word, there are various kinds reasons that people need to work, some of which usually combine to each other. So far as to me, however, making continuous progress is one the most important reasons because it is people's one of the most expected aims in their life, and work gives people a very effective approach to reach the aim.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Although people work to earn money, money is not the main reason people stay in their jobs. They also work because they enjoy working, they receive job satisfaction, and they like the sense of accomplishment. 
	Most people work for work's sake. They enjoy going to an office, or store, or school each day. They like to interact with other people. They like to help people solve problems, learn something, or get a product. People like to help other people. 
	A lot of people keep the same job because the job gives them a lot of satisfaction. They genuinely enjoy what they do. This is true for most teachers. A teacher's pay is not very great, but the job satisfaction can be very high. Helping someone learn is one of the greatest things anyone can do. 
	People enjoy their work because they like the sense of accomplishment. They like to know that they finished a project. People who work in factories take pride in the car they produce or the television they assemble. When they see a car on the street, they can feel a sense of accomplishment. They helped make that car. 
	Money is nice, but it is not the only reason people get up and go to work each day. I believe that people work because they enjoy the act of working; they find their work personally rewarding; and they like the feeling of a job well done.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: When talking about working, some people always complain a lot about it. They regard working as affliction which means hardship, vapidity and low earnings. They may even dream that they can also live a happy life without working. But as we all know, that won’t come true. Everyone needs to work for many different reasons. I believe the three most common reasons is to acquire knowledge, to seek fame and to enjoy life. 
	In the first place, we work to practice our skills and we have to learn many aspects of knowledge to solve the problems and to overcome difficulties. So working makes us skillful and effortless. The experiences we learn from working are the most important wealth. They are the major sources of wisdom. If we don’t work, how can we improve our intelligence and then how can we create wonderful lives? 
	In the second place, we work to realize our value by producing large amount of goods and serving the others. Farmer is not a farmer until he plant corps, teacher is not a teacher until she instruct classes. They all have their responsibility and they also receive our respects because of their contributions to the society. That’s the meaning of the life, which gives us courage and confidence to exert our powers to build happy home. 
	In addition, we work to keep us healthy. We can communicate with each other during work. Meanwhile, we are helped and encouraged all together. However, if we don’t work, we will become torpid and fat. We have to work to relieve our pressure. When you do something you are very competent to, you will view it as a kind of entertainment. You even find joy from them. 
	In conclusion, I believe working is a tool by with we can make a key to the gate of knowledge, it is a road which leads to tomorrow, and it is a drug which can keep us fit. All in all, working provides us so much that I love work.
@Notes: 
Topic 49.	Face-to-face communication @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Face-to-face communication is better than other types of communication, such as letters, email, or telephone calls. Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.
Essay 1: There are many different ways of communications, such as letters, emails, or telephone calls. However face-to-face communication still remains the most efficient way of communication between people. 
	Firstly, in face-to-face communication people can get direct response from the other party. When we talk with our friends, we can get feedback immediately from their verbal response, body language and facial expressions. Based on these responses, we can know what's the next step to take, such as how to carry on the conversation, and change the direction or finish the conversation if necessary. Sometimes, speaking words and body languages may not mean the same thing. Although we can hear words from a telephone conversation from our friends but we do not always know if they really mean it. This is also true in criminal inspections. Police inspectors can judge whether the suspect is telling the truth through his or her body languages, therefore get new clues and solve a criminal case more quickly. Thus, face-to-face communication is more perceptible and can help us understand a speaker's true feeling better than other ways of communication. 
	Secondly, face-to-face communication is the most helpful way to express ourselves. In communication it is just not enough for us to say the words; we need eye contact, body language to express our feelings. Sometimes we are so happy or angry that we are out of words. At these times, there is nothing more efficient to express our happiness or anger than a big hug or turn our face to another side. When we are a tourist in a foreign country, language is not always enough, and gesticulations might help us get understood more quickly. We can order in a restaurant by simply pointing our fingers to the menu when we do not know how to pronounce an item exactly. 
	Finally, face-to-face communication is indispensable in situations such as a relationship. Lovers need body contact such as a hug, a kiss and more, which cannot be done in letters or emails. Although lovers can use letters or emails to communicate, being apart for a long time is definitely not beneficial to a relationship. 
	In brief, face-to-face communication is a very important way for us. It is good for better understanding. It is more visible, direct and more effective than any other ways.

Essay 2: I would have to agree that face-to-face communication is the best type of communication. Face-to-face communication can eliminate misunderstandings immediately, cement relationships, and encourage continued interaction. 
	If you are talking to someone directly, you can see right away if they don't understand you. A person's body language will tell you they disagree or don't follow your line of thought. You can repeat yourself or paraphrase your argument. If you had sent an e-mail, the person may have misinterpreted what you wanted to say. He or she could be insulted and you would have to waste time explaining yourself in another e-mail. 
	When you talk face-to-face, you communicate with more than words. You communicate with your eyes and your hands. You communicate with your whole body. People can sense that you really want to communicate with them. This energy bonds people together. Your relationship with a person can grow much stronger when you communicate in person. 
	Face-to-face encounters tend to go on longer than other forms of communication. An e-mail lasts a second; a telephone call, a few minutes. However, when you meet face-to-face, you've made an effort to meet with the person, and the person has made an effort to meet with you. You will probably spend longer together talking. The longer you talk, the more you say. The more you say, the stronger your relationship will be. 
	In summary, if you want to establish a relationship with another human being, the best way is talking face-to-face. When you communicate directly, you can avoid misunderstandings that may occur in writing. You can communicate on levels other than just words and you can spend more time doing it.

Essay 3: With the rapid growth of high technology, computer, telephone and other communication tools have become more and more important in our daily life, so what people have gradually ignored face to face communications. 
	If I were asked whether face-to-face communication is better than other forms of communications, such as email, phone calls or letters, I would choose email and phone calls. Here I am going to enumerate some reasons to support my choice. 
	The main reason is that communication by telephone or by e-mail is more convenient. There is no need to make appointment with friends before meetings; all you need is just to remember their phone numbers or email addresses. Wherever you are and whenever it will be, communication is as easy as face-to-face talking. Moreover, it is more efficient for people to communicate. 
	Another important reason is that the way people connect by email can make more friends. I have many friends on the Internet and we communicate each other regularly, so I have gained more information and knowledge in many other fields. 
	Last but not least, indirect communication such as emails and phone calls can avoid direct confrontation and embarrassment. Sometimes we may not feel comfortable to borrow something or ask for a favor from our friends, because we do not know their reactions. At this time, an email or a phone call can be more convenient and can avoid embarrassment. 
	If all these factors are contemplated, the advantages of communication through email or telephone carry more weight than those of face-to-face communication.

Topic 50.	Doing new or old things? @Some people like to do only what they already do well. Other people prefer to try new things and take risks. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.
Essay 1: I am not a risk taker. I like to do just those things that I am proficient at. I have learned that it is better to focus my attention, do one thing and do it well, and not try anything new. 
	When I was younger, I was always experimenting with a lot of different things. First I wanted to be a dress designer so I studied drawing. I couldn't draw so I decided to be a veterinarian, because I liked animals. I didn't like to see sick animals so I decided to be a historian. That suited me perfectly since all I had to do was sit in a library and read. I learned to focus my attention on one subject. 
	I’m a very good reader and history is very interesting to me. 1 decided not to read any other subject. I only read history books. I even focused my attention on Chinese history. I only read history books on Chinese history. I do one thing and I do it well. 
	I don't like to try anything new. If I read things in another area, I don't do well. I don't understand American history or English history. The names are confusing and the stories not interesting to me. I don't want to learn about anything else. Chinese history is my subject. 
	I may seem a bit stubborn, but I have learned what makes me happy. I don't like to take a risk with new things. I like to focus my attention on one subject, do it well, and not try anything new.

Essay 2: When asked about the approaches to life, many people have the idea that change and new experiences bring us a meaningful life. However, others take the view that staying the same and not changing the usual habits is the better way of the life. In fact both approaches have its advantages and disadvantages, which are listed as follows. 
	Some people believe change and new experiences provide us a meaningful life because when we adapt to the change and new environments, we must face the difficulties and try our bests to overcome them. This process not only builds our personality, but also gives us a varied and meaningful life. What’s more, the change around us improves our adaptation and independence. They have a benefit for us to compete for survival in the society. Let’s suppose we always stay the same and do not change the environment. Then if someday we have to step into another environment, how can we adapt to in? 
	On the other hand, people who hold an opposite view consider that sticking to usual habits is the better way to life. They point out that the longer you keep the same habits, the more adaptive you are and you may live comfortably. They firmly point out that usual changes make you acquaint with nothing, and then it is impossible for you to have a happy life. In order to see this point clearly, they give us g good example: If you change your environment every month, you have to always change your habits and customs. Then how can you have a meaningful life?
