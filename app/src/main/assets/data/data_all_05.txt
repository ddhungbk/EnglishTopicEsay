Topic 101.	Doing work by hand or using machines? @Some people like doing work by hand. Others prefer using machines. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: Here's the problem. I'm sloppy. That's why I like to use machines to do my work rather than do things by hand. Machines can be creative, precise, and efficient. 
	Most people think that you can only be creative if you do things by hand. However, it takes creativity to set the machine up. Once it's set up, it can repeat the same task over and over and over perfectly. If you want to write ten letters, you can set up your word processor to do it, press a button, and ten letters will be printed. It would take me forever by hand, and I would make a lot of mistakes. By hand, each letter would be different. By machine, each one is perfect. 
	Machines are very precise. They don't get tired and cut the wrong way. They don't get distracted and drop some mustard on the paper. As I said, I'm sloppy, but I like neatness. That's why I prefer to use machines. 
	Machines are also more efficient. I'm too tired to pick up the phone and see who is calling me. My answering machine isn't tired. It's always on duty. It doesn't get tired, upset, or moody. 
	I can depend on my machines, but I can't always depend on my hand to be creative, precise, or efficient.

Essay 2: In general, there are two ways of making products, one is by hand and the other is by machine. It is undeniable that products can be manufactured easily and efficiently by machine due to simply repeated operations. But for me, I prefer hand-made items for their features of individualism, acceptability, and flexibility. 
	First of all, hand-made products are more personal. Take birthday cards as example, instead same pictures on selling cards in the market, the well-chosen images on a self-made cards, such as people’s own photos, surely distinguish the card from those selling ones. Owing to the uniqueness, the self-designed card will be of greater value for the person who receives it. 
	What’s more, things made by hand are fitter and more suitable. This can be seen from the story of ordering formal clothes, such as men’s suit and lady’s evening dress, the ready-made kinds of which actually are easy to find in fashion shops. Needless to say how often famous figures, like Princess Diana, visit worldwide known fashion designers. Nowadays more and more ordinary people go for tailor-made clothing rather than buy those machine-made clothes from market simply because tailors can make clothing precisely according to customer’s measurement and their own styles. Obviously, fitness and suitability are what those people care about most. Finally, producing items by hand is more flexible. It releases people from being confined by some models that are necessary for machine-made manufacturing. For example, in hand-made pottery making, people can work out their new design at any time. In machine-made manufacturing, however, models have to be developed in advance, and afterward all finished products based on one model have completely same looks. If a different look needed, people must devise another model first. Moreover, there are still some things cannot be produced by machine because of no matched models.

Topic 102.	Student evaluate their teachers @Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: I agree that school should ask students evaluate their teachers. There are three reasons: 
	The first, the education is an activity that communicate each other. The information that students evaluate is given to their teacher. The teacher can improve their education skill by this information. If there are no evaluated information by student, the education activity become unilateral activity. The teacher spread their information to students, but the students' information reflects back to teacher are very few. The evaluation can help teacher improve their skill from time to time. 
	The second, the evaluation is favor to school management. The management of school evaluate the education of teacher by students’ evaluation. The management may prize the good teacher and criticize the bad, and lay the disqualification teacher. 
	Finally, the evaluation is in favor to protect rights of students and parents. Students and parents are consumers, they hope that their children will receive good education certainly, they should protect their rights for themselves. When they find the educational skill of the teacher is bad, they may have school changed the teacher immediately. 
	In a word, I agree this point that students evaluate their teacher.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: I think it's a good idea for schools to ask students to evaluate their teachers. This informs teachers of how students react both to their teaching methods and to them as individuals. Teachers can weigh the criticisms and change what they think needs to be changed. Praise from students is also valuable. It can reinforce teachers' opinions about how they're teaching and give them confidence. 
	It's also helpful for school administrators to hear what students think about their teachers. It keeps administrators in touch with what's going on in the school. It also gives them some idea of which teachers effectively reach the students. However, good administrators know that student evaluations need to be reviewed with a keen eye for prejudice and adolescent attitudes. After all, an evaluation is a good way for students to get back at teachers who expect more of them than they want to give. 
	Evaluating teachers is also a good exercise for the students. They have to organize their thoughts about what they think of their teachers. In that way, they pinpoint for themselves what they expect of those teachers. They begin to understand what they value in a teacher and what is phony or useless. Evaluating their teachers is also a way for students to think about how they would evaluate themselves. Are they working as hard as they should in class? Is that why their teachers are sometimes critical of their work? Isn't that what a teacher should do-push us to try harder? Thinking about these things can help students do better in class. At the very least, they will understand better what is expected of them. 
	Student evaluations of teachers also make students feel as if they have a voice in what happens in their schools. It makes them feel as if they're pan of the education process when their opinion is valued by the administration. Finally, it teaches them responsibility.

Topic 103.	The most characteristic to be successful @In your opinion, what is the most important characteristic (for example, honesty, intelligence, a sense of humor) that a person can have to be successful in life? Use specific reasons and examples from your experience to explain your answer. When you write your answer, you are not limited to the examples listed in the prompt.
Essay 1: Although honesty, intelligence, and a sense of humor are all worthwhile characteristics, I feel the most important one in life to have is sensitivity. A sensitive person is aware of him/herself and the way their actions affect others. A sensitive person knows the place of honesty, intelligence, and a sense of humor. 
	Honesty is not always the best policy. There is such a thing as a white lie. You don't want to insult someone by saying that their new dress doesn't fit properly or that you wouldn't live in their new house if they paid you. You must be sensitive to when it is necessary to tell the truth and when it is better to tell a white lie. 
	Intelligence is a wonderful thing to have, but not all intelligent people use their intelligence sensitively. You don't want to show off and make others feel stupid. You must be sensitive to the reactions of the people around you. It might be appropriate for you to admit that you have the right answer, but in some cases, you might have to say, "I think this is the answer, but we might want to check it." A sensitive person would not make someone else look dumb. 
	A sense of humor is always valued. Different people, however, laugh at different things. You don't want to make someone feel uncomfortable by laughing at his/her mistakes. A sensitive person would understand whether a person could be teased or whether a person would appreciate a certain joke. 
	A sensitive person would make everyone feel comfortable. A sensitive person understands that people are different and that the values of honesty, intelligence and humor can be applied differently.

Topic 104.	The contributions of artists and scientists @When you write your answer, you are not limited to the examples listed in the question. It is generally agreed that society benefits from the work of its members. Compare the contributions of artists to society with the contributions of scientists to society. Which type of contribution do you think is valued more by your society? Give specific reasons to support your answer.
Essay 1: Basic to any social development in the 20 years after 1980s in China is the deeply recognition of the people, which is the gradual process of thinking a lot of the existed value of the scientists and the artists. Scientist or artist, who is the domination, makes people difficult to choose. The purpose of my issue is to provide sufficient evidence, details and examples from various perspectives to substantiate effectively and efficiently that significance of scientist is grossly greater. 
	To live, the most basically living requirement is food, clothes and place to live, which their entire source is the intelligent inventions of the scientist but not those of artist. Undoubtedly, fantastic paintings of Georgia O’Keeffe, wonderful music of Bach, moving dramas of William Shakespeare and the like which are the top articles in the world, make us live a life that full of beauty, wonder and fantasy. However, when we feel hungry or cold, nothing including music, painting, drama and so on, is greater impact our mind than the fresh bread or the down jacket, not mention to the person who create the articles - the artist. At this time, the person who invent and improve the farming machine to make crops strongly grow, the oven to bake the delicious bread, the machine to produce cloth, the scientist, will be appreciated, praised and thanked to. Because we cannot live without food and clothes but can the articles. 
	The articles and the artists are only the talking topics while we sitting in front of the furnace, having coffees after dinner and the like, not in the time we facing problems in working or in living. Once we meet a difficulty in doing something, the idea that solve the problem in a science method or look for help of scientists, spark at first in our mind. For example, a complex and confused math subject makes me extremely exhausted, the first and only thing I want is a calculator which can work it out by pressing a few buttons in seconds. Meanwhile, my favorite Bach, Mozart, Shakespeare and their articles are all out of my mind and have no help with it. 
	Therefore, the significance of the scientists among the contributions for human beings is more considerable than that of artists because the science has the superiority that the art cannot surpass in the basic life of people.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Artists and scientists both make valuable contributions to our society. It may seem sometimes that artists are more valued. That's because those artists who are famous make a lot of money. However, they are relatively few. The fact is that scientists are more valued. They get more respect from society for the work they do. 
	Artists reflect their times and their culture. A painter or a writer shows us in pictures and words what we're like as a people. They record our culture for future generations. Actors and other performers, like singers and dancers, entertain us. They take our minds off our troubles, and remind us how beautiful and exciting our imaginations can be. Artists also help keep their societies mentally and emotionally healthy. For example, children that participate in the arts, such as painting or music, in school do better in their other studies. Art of all types is necessary to the human spirit. 
	The contributions scientists make to society are more obvious. They include the cars we drive, the computers we use at home and at work, and the appliances that help us cook our meals and clean our houses. All of these come from the ideas and hard work of scientists. Because of scientific discoveries, we're living longer and more healthful lives. Scientists also contribute to the arts. Movies are the result of science. So are television, radio, and the recording of music on CDs. 
	Generally, scientists don't make as much money as famous artists like film stars, opera singers or successful painters. However, our society gives them more respect, and they generally make a good living. Scientists are considered to be serious professionals, while artists are sometimes viewed as flaky, irresponsible people. So overall, I'd have to conclude that we value scientists more.

Topic 105.	Dorm or apartments? @Students at universities often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. Where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.
Essay 1: I think it's better for college students to live on-campus their first two years, and then move into an apartment off-campus their last two years. Freshmen and sophomores need the stability of campus life, while juniors and seniors need the independence of off-campus life. Students' needs change over four years, so their housing should too. 
	Living on-campus makes it easier to get oriented to the way things are done. You get the whole university experience. Plus, you interact more with other students. This includes not only your roommates, but everyone in your dormitory. The older students in the dormitory can be a big help for the new students. Keeping up with studies your first year is hard enough. You shouldn't have to worry about finding your way around and figuring out the university bureaucracy. 
	Living in the dormitory also makes a student feel more a part of the university community. There are more opportunities for becoming involved in university activities and networking with student leaders and university administration. 
	Living off-campus, however, is a definite advantage for older students. Finding an apartment, dealing with leases and the landlord's regulations, cooking meals, and figuring out budgets are all good practice for life after graduation. This kind of independence helps older students grow into adulthood. 
	Off-campus housing also gives students a better perspective on what's going on around them. Campuses can be like little worlds of their own. There are few children or older people and everyone is focused on education. Getting to know neighbors who aren't students is good for students coming from different places. It's a chance to find out what other people think and feel. 
	I think a combination of two years on-campus and two years off-campus is a winning combination for most students.

Topic 106.	What method of travel? @You need to travel from your home to a place 40 miles (64 kilometers) away. Compare the different kinds of transportation you could use. Tell which method of travel you would choose. Give specific reasons for your choice.
Essay 1: Now I face a choice that I am in decision which transportation I should take to go to another city, which is 40 miles from my location. 
	While by bicycle, train, bus, and on foot are the basic four choices for me. The first one is a good way to excise my body, but too tiring and time consuming; The second way is economical to save time, while not always convenient, for sometimes there is no train at the exact time that available for me, that is to say, maybe I need to wait more than half an hour for the train; As for the last method, it is not in my consideration at all for I do not think one can do a good job by driving as long as forty miles expect that he has ever do some professional training in long run. 
	Obviously, I would like to choose bus as my tool for this journey. Firstly, bus facilitate me in schedule, for, as a matter of fact, almost there is a bus available each ten minutes for my travel or even more often. Secondly, it is also efficient by bus to fulfill this journey. Thirdly, I will really enjoy myself during the travel for the comfortable in bus, with TV or music supplied throughout the traveling time. 
	To summary, having a journey like forty miles, bus, as a transportation, is definitely the first choice. While if it is a much longer one, train will promote to be a replacement among these four. Lastly, bicycle or running can fit for a short one.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: There are many different types of transportation which I could use to travel 40 miles from my home. The type of transportation I would choose depends mainly on how fast I need to get there and how much money I have. Some possibilities are walking, horseback riding, driving, or using a taxi, bus, or train. 
	The most economical choice is walking. It costs nothing, is healthful, but it is time consuming. The average person can walk about 4-5 miles per hour, so this trip would take at least 10 hours to complete. That means I would probably have to spend the night somewhere along the way. If I have to spend money for a hotel, then this choice really isn't free. Plus, I might arrive at the end tired and with sore feet! After walking comes animal transportation. In my area, horses are not common, so it wouldn't be a likely choice. I believe that a 40-mile trip would take 2 or 3 hours on a horse. If I had free access to a horse, the cost would be minimal. Of course, I'd have to know how to ride! 
	With a car, the travel time is minimal (under one hour), with only the cost of gasoline to consider. However, I don't own a car, and car rentals are expensive. Shared taxis are one form of affordable transportation, with 4 or 5 people sharing the cost of a car trip to a common destination. The only downside is finding people to share the fare with me. Fortunately, I live in an urban area, where there are buses and 'trains to ride. One of these would be my first choice. 
	In short} the kind of transportation depends on how fast I need to get to my destination and how much money I have. If I need to get there fast, and money isn't important, I can hire a private taxi. Since I don't own my own car, I don't have that option, and I have never walked 40 miles in one trip. I usually depend on the bus and trains, and would do so in this circumstance. They are cheap, dependable and reliable.

Topic 107.	University and good students @Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.
Essay 1: Both good and bad students should have the opportunity to attend college. Everyone should have a period to learn about themselves before they begin to work and earn money. An education is an investment in yourself and in your future. Good or bad, a student must decide to invest real money and real time. 
	Higher education is very expensive. It might seem like a waste of money to send someone to college who might not be able to handle the course work. Still, education is a valuable investment in future career earnings. People with college degrees make more money and have more opportunities later. If people have a desire to improve their lives, do we have the right to say no? 
	Higher education is also a big investment of time. Some people think a weak student should get a job and earn some money. They think poor students shouldn't waste their time at college. But college is a time to meet different people, separate from your parents, and begin to define yourself as a person. I think that's an experience every student should have. 
	I think every student should be given a chance to see how far she can go. Students who got poor grades in high school might do very well in a different environment. College may be expensive and take time, but it's an investment in one's self and one's future.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Other people take the view that higher education should be available only to good students. While both methods may have their advantages and disadvantages, they can be applied under different circumstances. Afterwards, I will explain my opinion about it. 
	For every student, having the opportunity to being educated in a college is truly a good news. If a country can afford higher education to each of its students, we can call it a great country, because education is the power which enhances a country's economy. America, Germany and other countries which have highly developed education give us good examples. 
	But this also demonstrates that offering higher education to everyone does not mean that a country can receive the corresponding profit from its investment. Is it a truth that each student who receives higher education can eventually become a qualified graduate who can find a suitable place in the society? 
	Moreover, offering higher education to every student will result in the decrease of the educational efficiency. Suppose that if everyone can go to college without any restrictions, the campus will be crowded, the library will have less space for students and lose its calmness. Teachers have to face hundreds of heads in the classroom. We couldn't expect any good educational quality from such condition. 
	Making higher education available to good students, on the other hand, is no doubt an efficient way. Limiting the quality of the students is like selecting good mineral source. Only locating the miner in a potential place can we get what we need. For example, in Germany, students of different levels go to different schools. Those students who is promising have the chance to enter university for higher education. Under this circumstance, various schools produce various competent persons serving in various places of the country. 
	In my opinion, offering higher education to good students is better than to every student in two ways: First, it can keep the quality of the high education from decreasing. Second, it will help the development of the economy by producing excellent graduates who is available in different parts of the country machine.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Depending on personal experience, personality type and emotional concern, some people hold the opinion that a college education should be available to all students; meanwhile others consider the idea that higher education should be available only to good students in somehow more preferable. As far as I am concerned, I have to declare myself as one of these who agree that higher education should be offered to all the students. Among countless factors which influence my choice, there are three conspicuous aspects listed as follows. 
	The first and foremost cause for my propensity is that all students should have the same opportunity to attain a further chance of studying. Born equally as all of us, it is impartial that we all can approach a better education. From the view of equity, it will be unfair that some students get the best possible education while others are denied from a college education. 
	Another reason why I cast my preference for the point that higher education should open to all students is that our high-education should serve the function of educating the whole country, not merely for a minority of its people. 
	Beyond these obvious aspects, there is a further subtle point which we must take into our account. It would not be too kindly disposed to the bare idea that allowing barely fantastic students to enter universities, because it is economical for part of people to be better educated with limited resources of all kinds. Nonetheless, pound for pound, I reckon that the consideration that higher education should be accessible to all students is awfully advantageous. 
	To sum up, a higher education is never absolutely just a dream of the students without a terrific mark. It is a dilemma for the public to choose from the two object opinions because they are from time to time confused by the seemingly good qualities of the thinking that higher education is available merely to good students but neglect the genuinely good qualities of the true one. From the factors presented above, I strongly commit to the notion that a further education should be rendered more widely and openly.
@Notes: 
Topic 108.	The best way of learning about life @Some people believe that the best way of learning about life is by listening to the advice of family and friends. Other people believe that the best way of learning about life is through personal experience. Compare the advantages of these two different ways of learning about life. Which do you think is preferable? Use specific examples to support your preference.
Essay 1: Both learning through personal experience and learning through the advice of others can help you in life. If you don't have a lot of knowledge about something, the advice of people you trust can be very valuable. They can tell you about their own experiences, and about the advantages and disadvantages of a situation. Then you can consider your own wants and needs and decide what you should do. Pretty soon, you'll have more experience of your own. 
	When you’re thinking about what you want to do with your life, friends and relatives are a great resource. They can give you information about things like jobs, school, volunteering, and traveling to other parts of the world. They've done a lot of learning in their lives, and you can use it to decide what you want to do with yours. 
	In some cases, there's no real substitute for personal experience. For example, I really don't like to make presentations in class. I know I'll make mistakes, even if I'm thoroughly prepared and know all about my topic. Nothing but experience can help me deal with the nervousness I feel. I know that the feedback I get from the teacher and from the other students will help me learn from those mistakes. At least I'm confident that the next class presentation I make will be much better than the last one. 
	In the end, I think that the best way to learn about life is by experiencing it first-hand. No one else can teach you how to get along with other people, how to realistically judge your own abilities, or how to understand who you are. You can only learn these things by dealing with situations every day. Experience is the best teacher.

Topic 109.	Following the customs of new country @When people move to another country, some of them decide to follow the customs of the new country. Others prefer to keep their own customs. Compare these two choices. Which one do you prefer? Support your answer with specific details.
Essay 1: Nowadays it is quite common for people to immigrate to other countries. When they move, some of them decide to follow the customs of the new country while others prefer to keep their own. If I were forced to agree with one of the two positions, my choice would be the former. 
	To illustrate my point, let us first take a look on why some people dislike the idea of following the customs of the new country. For one thing, these people are so accustomed to their own culture, religion and customs, and it is very hard for them to accept the new cultures. For instance, people from an Islamic country may find a lot of customs in western countries offensive. 
	Although I agree that some customs are hard to change, I insist that the advantages of adapting to a new culture are apparently seen. In the first place, by following the customs of the new country, you can learn about the country and understand the people more easily and become a real member of the country. People who stick to their way of life may sometimes feel lonely and isolated. To share the same custom means that having more things in common, and it can pull people together. Furthermore, you have to adapt to some customs of the new country, if they are written into the law. As a result, it is much more sensible to do as the Roman do. 
	In conclusion, I believe that the advantages of following the customs of the new country is obvious because you can easily learn about the country and be a real member of it. What is more, you can live more easily in a foreign country.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Some people adapt quickly to the customs of a new country while others keep their own customs. How do they decide? It's a difficult choice, and the decision is not always conscious. Many practical and social factors influence people. 
	Very often it depends on age. Older people have spent a lifetime doing things a certain way. Their social customs are part of who they are as people. It's very hard for them to start doing things differently. The younger generation finds it easier to leave behind the culture of their native country and adapt to the customs of their new country. They're not as set in their ways as adults are. Children also feel the pressure to fit in from the other kids in school. 
	A major part of adapting to the customs of a new country is learning that country's language. Children learn the language in school, and use it all day while going to class and playing with other children. But many times adults coming to a new country don't have time for formal language classes. Their first priority is getting a job. Sometimes they work with people from their own country, and they don't-have to use the new language. Or they may find a job that doesn't require much speaking at all. This means even if they're trying to learn the language, they don't have a lot of opportunities to practice it. 
	Another way of adapting to the customs of a new country has to do with how family members interact. Different countries have different ideas about how family members should relate to each other. Sometimes the adults will oppose changing what was normal in their native country. This can be a difficult adjustment to make, especially if their children are visiting new friends at home and seeing how different things are in the new country. 
	I believe that people who want to make their home in a new country need to find a balance. They should keep the best of their native culture and adopt the good things they find in their new country.
@Notes: 
Topic 110.	Spending your time @Some people prefer to spend most of their time alone. Others like to be with friends most of the time. Do you prefer to spend your time alone or with friends? Use specific reasons to support your answer.
Essay 1: If I had to choose between spending time alone and spending time with my friends, I'd rather be alone. I need this time alone to "recharge my batteries," to re-energize my mind and spirit. Being with friends can be fun and can help you get through the rough spots in life, but it's the time alone, I think, that forms you as a person. 
	When I'm alone, I have time to think about my goals and to develop a strategy to reach them. Of course, lean think about these things when I'm with others, but it's harder to concentrate in a crowd. Being alone gives me the quiet time to really think about my life and what I want to do with it. 
	Being by myself is also a good way to listen to the silence and relax completely. When I'm alone I can practice meditation and lower my stress level. That's a very good way to sharpen my powers of concentration. Too much time with friends means filling my mind with a lot of chitchat. That's enjoyable for a moment, but can dull my concentration. 
	Being with other people can also distort my view of things. It's easy sometimes to become too worried about what other people think of me, or what other people have that I don't. When I'm alone I have time to step back. I can see the real value of things, without being influenced by the opinions of my friends. 
	It's natural to want to be with other people, but I find the time I spend alone is more valuable to me in the long run.
@Notes: 
Topic 111.	Some or many friends? @Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Others choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Compare the advantages of each choice. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons to support your answer.
Essay 1: I think I prefer to have many different friends because we can learn more from having many different types of friends. If we have just a few close friends, then we cannot learn as much as we can if we have many friends. Therefore, I think it is better to have many different friends. 
	First, having many different friends can teach us about life and the world. I think you can learn many things about many different countries if you know people from all over the world. For example, if you have a friend from China and one from Iran, you can learn more about those two countries. If you just have friends from your country, then you do not learn very much about the world. 
	We can also have many different kinds of experiences if we have many different kinds of friends. For example, some people like sports, others like music, still others like to study. If we have many different friends with many different interests, then we can never feel bored and we can have a happy life. 
	Finally, if we have many different friends, then maybe we can have more help from people when we need it. For example, if we need some kind of help with something, but we don’t know too many people, then it might be difficult for us to get help. However, if we know many people, then it will be easy for us to find help when we need it. 
	Therefore, I believe that it is better to have many different friends in our lives. Having many friends can teach us about the world, we can have more fun with different friends, and we can get help more easily if we have many different friends.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: We all need to have friends, and I think the more friends we have the better. Friendship helps us learn how to trust others, what to expect from others, and how to profit from experiences. I want to have a lot of friends around me sol can learn more about myself from different people. 
	I want to have people around me that I trust and that I can depend on. We all need friends, both in times of trouble and in times of happiness. If I only have a few, friends, it impossible that they might not be available if I need them. If I have a lot of friends, it is more likely that they will be able to share my troubles or my good fortune. 
	I want to have people around me that surprise me. If I have just one or two friends, I know what to expect from them. I know how they will react. If I have a lot of friends around me, I will always be surprised. Each will have a different way of reacting to a situation. Observing this reaction and responding to it will teach me how to deal with strangers whom I might meet. 
	I want to have people around me that can teach me something about life. If I only have a couple of friends, I will know everything about them very quickly. If I have hundreds of friends, think what I will learn. Each day they'll teach me something new and show me a new way of thinking about something. 
	I have a lot to learn in life, so I want as many people as possible to help me. I want a lot of friends to show me how to have a good time. I'll do the same for them.

Topic 112.	Studying or playing? @Some people think that children should begin their formal education at a very early age and should spend most of their time on school studies. Others believe that young children should spend most of their time playing. Compare these two views. Which view do you agree with? Why?
Essay 1: There is much discussion above when should children begin to study? Some people think that children should start learning as early as possible. Other people, however, argue that young children could begin to study late. As far as I am concerned, young children should spend most of their time playing and not begin studying too early. 
	Why do some people think that children should begin to study early? For one thing, children are very good at learning because they have good memory and accept new things quickly. If they waste their time when they are young, they probably need to spend much more time in learning the same thing when they are older. As we all know, learning a foreign language is a pain to adults, but is very easy to a child under ten. 
	Although I agree there may be one or two advantages for children to begin to study early, I insist that the advantages of learning late far overweigh them. In the first place, people who spend most of their time playing could be more creative. Learning more means that children can know more, but also more restrictions will be pushed on them. If children play more, they may find many things interesting in their playing and raise many questions, such as "why can this happen", "Can I invent such a thing to help me?" As a result, they always have more wonderful thoughts than those who begin studying very early, which helps them to study and work creatively when they grow up. 
	In the second place, children could be more anxious to learn when they grow up if they spend most of their time playing. It is known that children like to play. Even if parents force them sitting in front of the table, they cannot concentrate on the studying stuff. Instead, they are thinking how to finish the study early and go to play. They will be bored in studying when they grow up, since they think they study for their parents. But Children who spend most of their time playing do not have the bad memory of studying. When they grow up, they will be willing to study even if parents do not monitor them, because they feel they are studying for themselves. 
	In conclusion, I believe that young children should play more not only because that they will be more creative, but also because they will be more anxious to learn when they grow up. Therefore, I strongly hold that all parents should not push their young children into studying too early.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Should children play more or study more? The question is what will be better for the child. There are benefits to both activities, but the answer depends on the details of the situation. 
	There are many things that could affect the outcome of the argument. What kind of a school is it? It could be a school where children sit at their desks all day long memorizing dates and facts. Or it could be a school where the teacher helps the children learn what they want to learn. I think the second kind is a lot better for a child than the first kind. 
	Similarly, what kind of play are we talking about? The child could be alone all day long watching television, which could make him or her bored and lonely. Or the child could be involved in group activities with neighborhood children of the same age, which could help him or her learn how to get along with others. 
	I think both study and play are valuable, so I would prefer to send my child to a school where there is a combination. I think a variety of activities makes learning easier for anyone at any age.

Topic 113.	If your community have a new university @Some people think that your community would be a good place to locate the university. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a new university in your community. Use specific details in your discussion.
Essay 1: The first advantage of having a new university built in my community would be the jobs it would bring to the community. Initially, the jobs would be those connected with the actual building of the university structures, such as brick layers and carpenters. Once the buildings were completed, the jobs would be those on the campus itself. Those would include teachers, office workers, custodians, and librarians. 
	Not all of the people the university hired would already be members of the community, so that would mean a lot of new people coming to town. Of course, a lot of students would come too. Two advantages of new people in town would be more taxpayers and a more diverse population. With more people paying taxes, there would be more money for schools, libraries and other community needs. With a more diverse population, there would be new stores, new restaurants (to serve different tastes) and new cultural influences. 
	Of course, there would also be disadvantages. More people living in the community could mean more houses being built. There would be more traffic on the streets, with the combination of new residents and students who bring their cars. Plus, more people would mean more public services would be needed. These services could include everything from trash collection to more schools to hold all the children of the new residents. New services might mean local taxes would have to go up, even though there would be more taxpayers. 
	Another disadvantage is that the personality of our community would change. It would go from being a place where everybody knows everybody else to a place where a lot of people are strangers. It would become a place with a lot of short-term residents, like the university students, who might not care as much about the town. 
	Communities always change over time, though, and overall I like the atmosphere of a "college town”. A new university would bring a lot of challenges, but I think it would be worth it.

Topic 114.	The influence on young adults @Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your position.
Essay 1: Although friends make an impression on your life, they do not have the same influence that your family has. Nothing is as important to me as my family. From them, I learned everything that is important. I learned about trust, ambition, and love. 
	Your family is with you forever. They are not going to leave you because they find another daughter they like better. They are not going to leave you because they think you are too much trouble. A family is permanent, while friends come and go. 
	Your parents are your role models. They will encourage you to do your best, to push yourself, and to improve yourself. Friends want you to stay the same; they don't want you to be different. A family is ambitious for you. Friends are not. 
	Your family teaches you about love. A family's love is not judgmental. They love you for everything you are. Friends may love you because you have a new car or because you go out with them on Saturdays. A family loves you. Friends only like you. 
	Without my family, I wouldn't know what to do. I wouldn't feel as secure. I might not have the ambition to go to school. I probably would be afraid to love. My family is my greatest influence.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: It is true that both of the family and friends play important roles in influencing young adults, and it is really hard for us to tell which the most important influence is. 
	In my opinion, the family plays the most important role. When a young child is born, he is brought up by the family not by his friends, and a child has the keener sense in learning than an older one. I think the family can meld the child in the following ways. 
	Firstly, the family is the first school a child should enter. There he learns and is taught how to learn. It is safe to say that the character of a person is determined in his childhood, and when it is the family which to make the determination. 
	Secondly, a good family will afford good education for the child. Now more and more Chinese family realize the importance of education, some even make their children study in foreign countries. All this is unable to choose for the child, that is, the family has the undeniable influence on the young adult. 
	Thirdly, when the child is in his young adult, the family still plays an important influence on him. For instance, I always feel the expectation of my parents and struggle to favor them. Which is a hard work, but I still think it is naturally that I, as a son, should meet the expectation of them. Thus, the family is really a strong influence on the young. 
	I make the family the important influence doesn't deny that the role of friends on the young adults. Only that friends' role is not as important as the family.

Topic 115.	Planning free-time activities @Some people prefer to plan activities for their free time very carefully. Others choose not to make any plans at all for their free time. Compare the benefits of planning free-time activities with the benefits of not making plans. Which do you prefer - planning or not planning for your leisure time? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your choice.
Essay 1: Both leisure time and working time form the whole parts of one’s life. Here leisure time has a broad definition. Because of its importance, people face the dilemma whether to plan or not plan for the leisure time. Which one I prefer depends on my own experiences, life style and emotional concerns. To be frank, I prefer to plan in my point of view. 
	Before rendering my opinion in detail, it is necessary to take a glance at the position of not planning at all. People who claim the opinion advocate that leisure time is the time for relaxing. Enjoying the time is the most important, why they have to plan for it by taking time and energy. If they want to watch TV, they will sit down to watch it without any hesitation. If they want to swim, they will change to the swimming suits. Enjoy everything at any time. 
	It is true that there are some advantages about not planning for the leisure time, but I would explain a few important reasons why I prefer to plan for it. The main reason is that planning for it carefully can avoid a lot of troubles. To illustrate this, there is an example that is very persuasive. Take swimming for example, if we plan it first, we would prepare the swimming suit, sun glasses, towels, cream and so on for it. We can enjoy the swimming time fully and pleasantly without forgetting anything. 
	Avoiding troubles is only part of the most important aspects, and another equally significant role of planning lies in that we can promote our studying and working effectively. This demonstrates the undeniable fact that suitable leisure time can help one to relax fully. For instance, when we work or study for a whole week, we have a plan to spend the weekend in the seaside. It is wonderful. Careful plan can make us fresh and exciting. 
	If all the factors are considered, we will find out that the advantages of planning for leisure time outweigh those of not planning. It is true that both views have strong foundations, but no one can ignore the added convenience and satisfaction offered by planning for it. Such experience will definitely be helpful in one’s later life.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: I think that free time is a precious thing for most of us. When we're working hard, it's nice to imagine what we'll do when the weekend comes. We juggle one idea with another, trying to decide what best suits our budget and the amount of time we have. After all, anticipating free time is part of the pleasure. 
	It's good to plan what we're going to do with our free time. That way we won't waste any of it trying to decide. It's so easy to just sit around and think about this or that activity. Before we know it, half the day is gone. If we decide ahead of time, we can get started in plenty of time, and we can get the most benefit out of the time we have. For instance, if we're going on a picnic, we can get all our supplies ready to go. Or if we're going to a movie, we can find out the time and how long it'll take us to get there. Also, if we plan what we're going to do with our free time, we can invite others to join us. If we wait until the last minute, our friends may have other plans. 
	On the other hand, it's also fun sometimes to do things without apian. We can just leave the house and walk around and see what catches our attention. Often, this is how we discover places we never knew existed. We might end up doing something we never thought we'd try. We might just happen to find ourselves outside a new bookstore or a bowling alley and go in on a whim, because we have some free time. 
	It's nice if we can have the best of both worlds. We can plan our free time activities for one day of the weekend, and let the other day plan itself. This way our free time also gives us the enjoyment of having it both ways.

Topic 116.	The best method of learning @People learn in different ways. Some people learn by doing things; other people learn by reading about things; others learn by listening to people talk about things. Which of these methods of learning is best for you? Use specific examples to support your choice.
Essay 1: The effectiveness of a learning method varies from person to person and also from activity to activity. Learning by doing, learning by reading, and learning by listening all have the transfer of information as their goal, but the information is transferred in very different ways in each case. Each has its benefits. In my own opinion, learning by doing is the method that works best for me. 
	Learning by doing works because it gives a learner first-hand experience. Other methods are more passive; you're either listening to a conversation or trying to pay attention to words on a page. However, learning by doing means actually participating in the activity. Can you imagine learning how to play a musical instrument from a book? As the saying goes, practice makes perfect. Frankly, I can't think of a way that better ensures one has truly learned than by seeing and doing. 
	In contrast, reading makes learning less easy to visualize. Not only that, learning by reading often requires extra research, such as looking up unfamiliar words. Also, you might not be a good reader, or you might be learning in a second language. If so, you might find it hard to concentrate or become frustrated by the slow pace. So while reading is fun and useful for many people, for others it may not be the best way. 
	Learning by listening can be enjoyable. Lively debate is interesting, and interesting things are usually easier to learn about. Plus, unlike reading, you can ask questions if you don't understand. 
	However, as with reading, it is all too easy to become a passive listener and not truly learn anything. If you get bored, you might even fall asleep while you're listening! When you're actively participating in something, you're more likely to stay alert. 
	Overall, when it comes to learning, I believe that nothing substitutes for the first-hand experience that physically doing an activity provides.

Topic 117.	Kinds of your friend @Some people choose friends who are different from themselves. Others choose friends who are similar to themselves. Compare the advantages of having friends who are different from you with the advantages of having friends who are similar to you. Which kind of friend do you prefer for yourself? Why?
Essay 1: There are a lot of advantages to having friends who are different from you. For one thing, they'll give you a different way of looking at the world. Friends who are different can introduce you to foods, music, politics, and books you've never tried before. If you're a spontaneous kind of person, someone who is more scheduled can help you get better organized. You, on the other hand, can help them loosen up a little bit, and do things more on the spur of the moment. 
	Someone who is different from you won't have the same reaction to situations. This can be a big help. If you're the kind of person who gets very impatient waiting for your meal in a restaurant, it helps to have someone calm with you. Your friend can help you keep your temper. If you're a little timid about standing up for yourself, a more assertive friend can help you develop a little more self-respect. 
	However, there can also be advantages to having friends who are similar to you. You usually enjoy doing the same things, so you don't have to argue about what you want to do. Sometimes it's fun experiencing new things. Other times, it's more fun doing what you know you'll enjoy. 
	All things considered, I think I'd like to have a lot of acquaintances who are different and a few close friends who are similar to me. That seems the best of both worlds.
@Notes: 
Topic 118.	Changing your usual habits @Some people enjoy change, and they look forward to new experiences. Others like their lives to stay the same, and they do not change their usual habits. Compare these two approaches to life. Which approach do you prefer? Explain why.
Essay 1: It is often difficult for people to choose whether staying the same or changing for a new experience. Each of the two has its own advantage and disadvantage. As a youngster with unlimited energy and enthusiasm, I will choose change without any hesitation. 
	The first reason I choose change is that change is the propeller that push the world to develop from an ancient tribe in which people hunted for their life, to today's earth on which people can study and work in their comfortable homes without worrying about life. What makes the thousands of years’ development possible is that people like to change the world. As we all know, by changing stones into stone axes, people could gather more meat for their families; by changing breast's fur into clothes, people keep themselves warm; by changing solar energy into heat and electricity, people can find a new way to prevent the energy shortage. Thus, it is change that develops the world we live in. 
	Second, let's come to our daily life. Change gives people a feeling of curiosity and drive him to discovery various new things around him. Everyone is curious about the new objects he saw and the news he heard, and has the pulse to detect everything. We are excited about moving into a new house, and we are excited about our new jobs. Even a little change of the furniture placing in our rooms can make us excited for a few hours. 
	The last and in my opinion a very practical reason is that change can improve people's adaptability. When you move to a new school, or come to a new job, your environment has changed. Therefore, in order to get used to your new surrounding quickly, you have to change yourself first. Perhaps, you have kept your regular habit for such a long time and it is a painful process for you to change yourself. But by doing this you will observe in the future that you are able to be adapted to more changes around yourself and that there is an expanded world in front of you. All of these result from that you have the courage to change yourself. 
	For the reasons presented above, I strongly commit to the notion that change makes our lives colorful and trains us to adapt to our world. People should enjoy change and look forward to new experiences.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: There is a famous Chinese proverb says, “The world is so big that it includes all kinds of men”. 
	Different people have different life styles. Some people enjoy change and new experiences. Others like their lives to stay the same. Frankly, I prefer to change in my point of view. 
	Before rendering my opinion in detail, it is necessary to take a glance at the position of the opposite view. A lot of people, especially the old, advocate that staying the same is safe and pleasant. They think that the life has no up and down is the best one. Someone will also say if you stick to one point, it would be better. For example, the famous Chinese Opera actor Mei Lanfang kept his usual habit to observing birds and fish. At last, he succeeded in his eye acting. 
	It is true that staying the same has a lot of advantages, but I will explain some important reasons why I prefer to change. In modern society, the world is changing in every minute. If we do not change, how can we keep pace with the world? A small example could give some light to this point. Some young people like traveling from one place to another. New experiences could let them understand the world fully. 
	Another equally significant advantage of changing is that we can explore our talents better and deeper. Some people like to change jobs. They believe that new jobs can give them chances to understand themselves and choose one is the most suitable for them. Take Chancer for example, he had been a courtier, a soldier, an ambassador and a legislator. Finally, he became the noted writer. 
	Considering all the factors, we will find out that the advantages of changes outweigh those of staying the same. Both views have strong foundations, but no one could ignore the convenience and satisfaction offered by change and new experiences. Such experiences will definitely be helpful in one’s later life.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: There are those who prefer things to stay the same, while there are others who prefer change. My personal preference is to establish a routine and stick to it, though this has not always been true of me. 
	When I was younger, I wasn't a creature of habit. I enjoyed change. When summers came and I was free from the responsibilities of school, I would travel, take off with friends at a moment's notice, and make decisions from day to day. In this way, I had lots of new experiences, met new and interesting people, and learned a lot about life. 
	These days, I enjoy sticking to a routine. This is partially due to the fact that I am a mother of two small children. I find that their lives are happier if I don't upset their schedules too much. For example, we give the children a bath every night at 8:00, put them in their pajamas, read them stories and put them to sleep by 9:00. There are times when this is inconvenient, but everyone in the household is happier if we stick to our routine. In addition, our friends know when to find us at home and when we are free. This makes visiting easier. 
	In conclusion, the type of person I am has changed with the circumstances of my life. The obligations of my family force me to have a routine. When I was young, I enjoyed the suspense and adventure of living a crazy life. Now the stability of a household routine suits me better. I think that while most people need a minimum amount of security, those who depend on you often make a difference in your lifestyle.
@Notes: 
Essay 4: living in this world, people keep different rules and preference to their life. Some people prefer to experience what they do not know, some choose to regular their life and enjoy the quiet. Obviously, no one is wrong, while as for me, my personal opinion is similar with the former. 
	By positively changing their life people can enrich their knowledge. As for from the change of their job, People will meet the new environment where they must work hard to learn new techniques and skills to catch up with the new coming requirements. Staying in a stated position, people tend to be involved in their daily activities with all their time and energy without further progress. 
	Consciously changing their life will also benefit people to live happily. The feeling of life is boring is for sure coming to human being step by step if they always keep a stagnating living. As we all know, lots of couples complain their life is full of dull, and he or she also grumble that cannot feel their affection existing anymore. Why? It is, to some extent, for that they do not realize they should change they everyday life from being stagnation. No changed life tend to make people tired and loose interest. A report said the contemporary social problem of youth suicide is very seriously, and investigation shows the reason is mainly for the kids feel their life is no novel. If only they were taught how to absorb the fresh air into their life! 
	I would like to claim again, keeping old habits and enjoying a stated life are not bad also, what they need is to use another way to make their life positive.

Topic 119.	Clothing and people's behave @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People behave differently when they wear different clothes. Do you agree that different clothes influence the way people behave? Use specific examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: I agree to the statement that people behave differently when they wear different clothes. Clothes play an incredible role in our daily life. It rules our behavior and defines to new culture in modern society. I am also keeping observing the way people's behavior with dressing different clothes. 
	The results of these observing are surprisingly similar. Person dresses in clean suit and wear polished shoes, his gesture would comport to be elegant. On the contrary, the same one dresses in leisure sporting T-shirt, sneakers, correspondingly, he will act arbitrarily with involuntary movements. 
	The reason is simple. The clothes are crucial dimensions to insinuate people's routine behavior every day. Psychologist calls it "Psycho-hint". So a clean suit and polished shoes would keep us in happy at some extent. Or some people have proclivities to dress in bright colour to relieve the pressure they faced. I think that a nice dress will give us more confident to handle the problem. We also build professional, sophisticated impressions for other people. 
	Otherwise, People will probably be unresponsive to deal with things in casual dress. This is related to our future career directly. Such as, we should dress tidily for job inter-view, just to give an examiner a good impression. Nice clothes are perfect advertisement for individual image as same as the package in the shop market. We choose the attractive package, same, we feel close with a stranger dress in proper clothes. 
	To this extent, clothes reflect our special national custom and culture. These reminds root at our customs, personal discrimination, and occupations. Calvin Kelen is famous for his simple style that defines the apparel of the whole American young generation in the early 20th century. We also find that people in different occupations wear differently. Bank employees, businessmen usually dress in dark suit since they should offer clients reliable impressions. Teachers wear nice clothes that let their student feel kindly. 
	Track to the long human history, our predecessor have developed the complete clothes system. From the primitive leather to elaborated modern metal, clothes offer us the chances to express our unique views and show us the colorful life. So do you consider that buy a nice apparel for yourself when go out next time?
@Notes: 
Essay 2: People do behave differently depending on what they are wearing. The reason is not because they have changed, but because people's reactions to them has changed. 
	Certain clothes are appropriate for certain situations. A man can wear a suit to work and a woman can wear something professional looking like a skirt and jacket. 
	When everyone dresses the same, there is no problem. It is like a uniform. Imagine going to a law office to hire a lawyer. One of the lawyers is wearing a suit; the other is wearing jeans. Which lawyer do you want to hire? Similarly, a mechanic works on cars all day and wears clothes that can get dirty. It would be strange to find a mechanic wearing a coat and tie to repair an engine. 
	People will treat you differently depending on what you are wearing. It will depend on how well they know you and where you are. If your clothes are unusual for the situation, they may treat you with disrespect. I remember once I had an old army coat. I wore it into a fancy candy shop to buy some chocolates. The woman was very suspicious and a little afraid. I couldn't understand her reaction since it was still me underneath my big, old ugly green coat. I was dressed like a bum and this caused the salesperson to react negatively to me. Consequently, I was even more polite than usual. 
	This experience shows me that sometimes I do behave differently because of what I'm wearing. In this case, I had to balance my appearance. Still, that doesn't mean that I'm rude if I dress up.

Topic 120.	The decisions that be made quickly @Decisions can be made quickly, or they can be made after careful thought. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The decisions that people make quickly are always wrong. Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.
Essay 1: I disagree with the statement that the decisions people make quickly are always wrong. However, I think those decisions probably turn out to be wrong more often than carefully made decisions do. Usually, fast decisions are based on what we call our "gut reactions," or feelings we have about a situation. Sometimes these gut reactions are based on good sense backed by experience, but sometimes they're based on nonsense or poor reasoning. 
	Let's say you're at work and the boss calls you to his office and tells you there's a big project that needs to be done. He thinks you're the best person for the job, but he needs an answer from you on the spot. He hasn't told you what the project is, but you make the quick decision to accept. This is the right quick decision, because you're basing it on a lot of factors that will occur to you later. One is that it wouldn't make sense for the boss to ask you to do something he didn't think you could handle. That would only hurt his business. Plus, doing a good job on this project might help your career. You realize it's good to reach higher, if you want to get ahead. 
	But let's say you're on a deserted highway late at night and your car breaks down. Along comes a car driven by someone who doesn't seem quite right to you. He offers you a ride to the nearest gas station. You make the quick decision to accept the ride because it's late, you’re cold and tired and you don't want to sit there waiting for the highway patrol to arrive. This is a case where a quick decision is a wrong decision. You shouldn't trade your personal safety for physical comfort, and if you thought about it, you wouldn't. 
	How do you know when it's okay to make a quick decision? You have to be able to guess at the possible benefits versus the possible dangers. If it's a small decision like where to go to lunch, .who cares? However, if my whole future were at stake, I'd want as much time as I could get to think about it.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Some people argue as if it is a general truth that to make a wrong decision is better than to make no decision at all. But to be frank, I cannot agree with them. In my point of view, it is sagacious to spend more time on preparing to decide rather than hurry to make a wrong decision. There are numerous reasons why I hold no confidence on them, and I would explore only a few primary ones here. 
	The main problem with this argument is that it is ignorant of the basic fact that a bad decision will influence the subsequence steps, and produce an unsuccessful result even a failure. There is a famous saying, a good beginning is an half of succeed. This proverb explain the important of decision of the beginning, while something say the deleterious effect of a wrong decision. For example, when a graduate is confronted with the choice the job after leave the campus, the first decision is every important for the future work and live. An inapposite choice could bring him or she successive problem, even mistaken the direction. 
	Another reason why I disagree with the above statement is that I believe that no hurry to decide let people have more time to prepare and maybe they find an appropriate approach. Since careful plan and deliberate arrangement will become the precondition of succeed, then spend more time on preparing is necessary. In the instance above, the graduate should think over all sorts of the factors, such as the qualification of himself or herself, the condition of the job and the advisement from consulter of the college and parents. 
	The argument I support in the first paragraph is also in a position of advantage because careful arrangement will discover the errors and mistakes in the decision. And that will have the chance to correct them, in order to make a right decision. The errors or mistakes could exist in everyone’s thought. I think the best way to eliminate them is think them over. So it is sagacious to spend more time on preparing to decide rather than hurry to make a wrong decision. 
	General speaking, the deliberate consider can help to avoid the appearance of trouble effectively and to resolve problems successfully. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that, it is wiser to make no decision at all than to make a wrong decision.
@Notes: 
Topic 121.	Judgement a person @Some people trust their first impressions about a person's character because they believe these judgments are generally correct. Other people do not judge a person's character quickly because they believe first impressions are often wrong. Compare these two attitudes. Which attitude do you agree with? Support your choice with specific examples.
Essay 1: In our daily life, we will always be told a wealth of such cases as a guy who has fallen into love with a girl at the first sight, one of your friends who impresses your mother deeply on his or her first visit to your house and then is treated exceptionally well by your hard-to-be-pleased mother, and even the applicant who attracts to the HRM (human resources manager) immediately at the first sight of the interview and then is easily employed, to name just a few. All of the abovementioned cases tell us many people in the world trust the first impressions of a person, his or her character, her conduct and her eloquence, etc., all of which he or she displays at each other's first meet. But is all that he or she displays, or all that you understand through what he or she displays or hints correct or just a blur image which needs to be proved in the later days? 
	Before we get the question to be treated, let’s think of the most probable (not absolutely) results of the cases mentioned in the first paragraph: 
	The guy who has just experienced the above-said romance has to say goodbye to his newly known girlfriend because later on he finds out that the girl is not as good as she looks; the friend of yours who has just won your hard-to-be-pleased mother's trust is criticized by your mother because of his or her great incoherency in the manners, and even the newly-employed employee is dismissed because of he is not telling the truth in his resume. Till now, do you still think the first impressions of a person’s character are dependable? 
	Psychologically, in our head we had a very perfect image of a person, of course, which varies from one another owing to his or her specific experiences, education and family background, his or her own opinion about a special view, etc. and when such a person as confirms with the image in our head pretty congruently presents, we will, to great extent, overestimate or even exaggerate the his or her merits, while omit the shortcomings as we can help it. Maybe this is the psychological reason, thus we can ourselves lead to the answer to the question referred above that the first impressions of a person are generally incorrect and also irresponsible for yourself. In a word, to judge a person needs time and the first-sight impression is always undependable.

Essay 2: Any opinion is, in fact, a judgment. I feel that as Americans we would do well to judge others less often. Still, we must be able to decide whom to spend our time with and whom we'd rather forget. In my opinion, this type of judgment is best after we get to know other people. First impressions are not always accurate impressions. 
	Judging a person based on a first impression does save time. There are more people than anyone could possibly get to know in one lifetime. It is frustrating to waste time getting to know someone, only to find out that your first impression was correct and that you really don't like him-or her. So is it a waste of time getting to know people you probably won't like? That seems to be a valid point of view, but I believe that it is not the best attitude to take. 
	It's more humane to spend time getting to know people before judging them. I know that I don't always make a good first impression, even when I truly like the person with whom lam interacting. We all have bad days. I wouldn't want to lose a job or a potential friendship simply because I picked out the wrong clothing or said something wrong. I think everyone deserves the chance to make a second impression. 
	If we all based our final opinion of others on first impressions, it would be hard to get to know anyone. There is always more to people than meets the eye. If we don't give someone a chance, we may be missing out on meeting a life-long friend. That would truly be a shame.

Topic 122.	Do people never satisfied? @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People are never satisfied with what they have; they always want something more or something different. Use specific reasons to support your answer.
Essay 1: I think it's probably true that people are never satisfied with what they have. They always want something more or something different from what is theirs. This just seems to be part of our human nature. Look at a toddler. Give her a toy to play with and she's happy-until she sees something eke. Then she wants that other toy to play with. If she and her brother are each given a cookie, she'll look to see whose cookie is bigger. She'll protest loudly if she thinks her brother is getting more. 
	"The grass is always greener" is an old expression, but it's a good expression of how many of us feel. We're always striving for a better job, a nicer place to live, a fancier car, or more expensive clothes. Part of this reaching for more and better is because we care about what other people think and want to impress them. Part of it is trying to make ourselves feel successful. But there's also something in our nature that tells us we can do better and reach higher. 
	This isn't always a negative quality. There's another saying: "A man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for?" It's a good thing to be constantly pushing ourselves and looking for something different. If we don't try for more and different things, we begin to, stagnate, like a pool that doesn't get any fresh water. 
	The problem comes when we won't let ourselves be satisfied with anything we have. If we have a comfortable life and still feel as if something's missing, then we need to look inward. The something that's missing may be in our spirit.

Essay 2: Many of the world's religions share a belief that when a person is able to look at and confess his or her problems that person can begin to travel the road to emotional recovery. A problem cannot be solved until it is clearly recognized. I agree with the above statement because I believe that dissatisfaction and suffering forces people to change. 
	History presents many examples of dissatisfaction and change. The history of China in this century might be seen as one of dissatisfaction and progress. Sun Yet San was discontented with the decaying imperial order, and so he created “revolution”; Mao was dissatisfied with the course of events and so he intensified the revolution; finally, Deng pushed the Chinese economy towards free-market economics. Hence, China progressed towards its new-found “superpower” status. 
	In a not dissimilar way, during the eighteenth century many Americans became annoyed with direct British rule, and so the United States fought for and gained political independence. 
	On a personal level, dissatisfaction can lead to change within friendship and marriage. Perhaps it might even be said that true love cannot remain static. Matrimony and friendship are explorations of the higher emotions: they are pilgrimages towards the city of true values. If husband and wife are prepared to confront and discuss their problems, a blue period can give way to many years of happiness. Sometimes, for instance, a spouse may not recognize that the source of marital unhappiness is that the other partner has developed a need to have children. Whatever else may be said, most people would agree that children change the lives of their parents. 
	The best method of utilizing dissatisfaction is to change things before they get out of hand. An intelligent man will constantly monitor his emotions; an intelligent politician will understand the mood of his people. Some people might suggest that the transition to independence for Canada and Australia was much smoother than that of the United States because Britain allowed those two dominions to evolve with time. To take the idea further, a good parent or an astute politician will even anticipate potential dissatisfactions and therefore take precautions. 
	I agree with the above statement because, I believe that we mature through dissatisfaction. Without the ability to recognize our discontent, we could collapse into illness. Suffering sharpens our senses.
@Notes: 
Topic 123.	Reading about real world @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should read only those books that are about real events, real people, and established facts. Use specific reasons and details to support your opinion.
Essay 1: How could anyone suggest that people should only read about real events, real people, and established facts? For one thing, that means people wouldn't be reading half of all the great books that have ever been written, not to mention the plays, short stones and poetry. For another, it would mean that people's imaginations would not develop as children and would remain dulled throughout their lives. 
	Reading stories as a child helps develop our creativity by teaching us a lot about how to use words to create mental images. It opens our world up, exposing us to other times and different ways of living. Reading histories of those times would serve kind of the same purpose, but it probably wouldn't stick in our minds as sharply. Reading an essay about poverty in Victorian England is not the same thing as reading Charles Dickens Oliver Twist. The images of a small boy being sold are more horrifying than simply reading the statement, "Children were sold into labor" because a novel makes that small boy seem real to us. Reading fiction makes a more lasting impression on our minds and emotions. 
	Besides, storytelling is an emotional need for human beings. From earliest times, humans have taught their children about life, not by telling them facts and figures, but by telling those stories. Some of these stones show what people are like (human nature), and help us experience a wide range of feelings. Some make us think about how we should act. Telling a child that it's wrong to lie will make little impression, but telling him the story of a little boy whose nose grows longer every time he tells a lie will make a big impression. 
	Fiction is too important to our culture, our minds, and our emotions. How could we ever give it up?
@Notes: 
Topic 124.	Important subjects for students @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for students to study history and literature than it is for them to study science and mathematics. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.
Essay 1: I have always considered that general knowledge is the best choice for me and universal learning the perfect means to support the phrase "knowledge for the sake of knowledge itself". But if I have to choose between the above-mentioned subjects I would definitely concentrate on art and literature which I consider fit better my personality. 
	Art and literature have a lot in common in that they require a different, quite often universal approach to the world around us. They concentrate not so much on the black and white aspects of living but on the colourful side of life; on tints rather than brightness. Math and science study the form, the physical shape and its laws, but it is art and literature that fulfill this form with that ultimate meaning that only the human soul can sense. 
	And it is the human soul that has so many faces, so many aspects and interpretations to all things. That is why I appreciate the subjectivity of art and literature-the numerous realities they impose are closer to our inner world than the strict powers that rule that of science. 
	One is free to tolerate, to criticize, to accept the form of art but not obey them. 
	It is believed that Order came from Chaos. And if we can associate science and math with Order it sounds logical to claim that Chaos has a lot to do with art and literature. The well of our unconscious brings forward the strangest powers and they show more of the universe than math and science do. For Chaos is the beginning of life. 
	Having in mind the above, I definitely support art and literature as a better means for achieving universal knowledge. What is more, while math and science closely deal with laws, they cannot in any way teach us about that "thin red line" separating bad and evil, while art and literature I strongly believe can.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Many people hold that studying scientific subjects is more beneficial than studying literary ones. However, I do believe that each field has its own importance on our lives. 
	Scientific subjects are definitely crucial to our development. We wouldn't have come that a long way in scientific and cultural advancement if we didn't have subjects like math, physics, chemistry and so on. We, wouldn’t have conquered the space if we didn't have astronomy. Also, we wouldn't have found cures for dangerous diseases if we didn't have medicine. Our life relies great deal on those subjects, so they are greatly vital to us. Yet, I believe that some people are born with the skill to handle scientific research while others tend more towards literary subjects. 
	Therefore, people born with literary talents are also very useful to us. Many aspects of our lives need to be treated by art and literature. As human beings we also have feelings and emotions and those things need to be cared for as well. So writers, painters and actors are functional elements in our everyday life. When you're tired and you want to relax you might watch a comic movie or take a nice romantic book to read. Moreover, arts like sculpture and painting play a huge role in our lives, in the sense that they add a beautiful and artistic touch to everything around us including our houses, offices and even the streets. Consequently, art is indispensable in our lives. 
	In fine, I believe that art and science are interrelated and binary coexisting in our lifestyles. In my opinion, one cannot replace the other. Each is necessarily needed in to improve our lives. We need the mathematician as much as we need the painter. Each has his own role to perform in the society.

Essay 3: The importance of playing games for adults has always been underestimated over the past years. However as newer studies are being undertaken in the field of human behavior, the value and significance of play in an adult human being's life is gaining vast importance. 
	From time immemorial, play has been a significant means of communication among children as a role model to the complex inter-personal communications among adults. The effectiveness of play to bring about bonding among other children/adults has been highlighted by scientists and sociologists all over the world. 
	In addition to the benefits of play on the physical systems of humans such as toning of the various organ systems to their optimum levels of functioning, the effects on the mental health of the individual are seen to have a greater bearing. 
	Furthermore, since man is more of a social animal, play tactics are often found to further enhance the individual's sense of self-esteem among the society he lives in. His functioning as a productive member of the community is further enhanced, and this also is seen to have an inhibitory effect on the negative aspects of one's personality. This holds good even in the face of the highly stressful lifestyles of today's people. 
	Truly, one cannot but agree whole heartedly with the old grandmother's saying “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy." Indeed, play for children and adults alike ensures a healthier, happier society.

Essay 4: At an early stage of human civilization science was not developed in random way. But today with the development of technology, science becomes more useful and cultural aspect for mankind. At every stage of life we use many scientific instruments. 
	Again science helps to provide entertainment for human beings. Nowadays science is progressed in more advanced way. By using technology, men are able to invent many new things. Mathematics is an important subject among other science subjects. 
	At every moment, people can able to calculate any problem by applying mathematics. To study other science subjects like physics, statistics, chemistry, etc., the knowledge of mathematics is very essential as it is very useful to solve any problem related to above subjects. With development of science we can able to use internet system. 
	By using this system we can able to collect any information about any topic. Or in other words human beings are completely related and depended on science. 
	To study art and literature is very useful for human beings. People can know about many past events by reading different history books. They can easily familiar with different culture by reading many literature. By studying geography, we can know about nature and environment. We can know about life style of many different cultural people by reading art and literature. 
	From the above discussions, it is clear that to study science is more important than to study art and literature. To study science helps us to live in more advanced way. Science stream is too vast and is developed in more advanced way that students in science stream have more facility to work in that field compared to art students.

Essay 5: In general, the knowledge can be divided into two types: natural knowledge and social knowledge. Science and math are the important component of former, while art and literature are essential parts of the latter. In my opinion, both of these are very important to any individual. The reason goes as follows: 
	First, only complete knowledge can make a really knowledgeable man/woman. We know that the world consists of not only the object studied by the subject like science and math, such as stars and flowers, but also consists of the beautiful and attractive things such as poems, paintings, which is studied by the subjects like art and literature. Lack of knowledge will lead to an incomplete view about the world. 
	Secondly, the study subjects like art and literature are helpful for the development of subjects like science and math. There are some rules that govern both types of subject, the master of one subject may be beneficial to the development of another subject. It is because of this reason that many great people are great artists as well as a scientists. It is known that Einstein played well in violin while he is acknowledged as a great physicist. It is believed by some people that grasp both types of knowledge is essential for anyone wish to be successful in the new millennium. 
	Of course, the study of science and math is very important. It is the study of them produce our modern society. However, an additional master of art and literature will make our life more colorful, and even more successful.

Essay 7: I think it's more important for students to study history and literature. These subjects help us understand the human race and feed our spirits and our imaginations. That's more important than understanding how to split the atom or do algebra. 
	People talk about a crisis of spirit in our country. They mean we've forgotten how to believe in and understand our own better natures, I think part of this is because we've become too excited about facts and not enough about things we can't see and measure. Reading books from our own culture helps us understand our roots. Reading books from other cultures helps us understand the way other people think and react to situations. It also teaches us that we're not so very different from others, and that leads to better relations between cultures. 
	Reading literature also feeds our spirits. Even when the material we're reading is about terrible sadness and hardship, it still brings us in touch with our inner selves. It makes us think about issues other than the new car we want to drive or how much money we're making. 
	Studying history gives us more information than just who died when or who won which war. It tells us about how human beings have related to each other at different periods in our development. It gives us the big picture. So often, when international crises occur, we only see the problem of the moment. We have no idea how something that happened twenty years ago was the beginning of this current problem. Without that information, we can have only a shallow understanding of what's going on in the world. 
	Both history and literature are necessary subjects for students to prepare for more than just careers. These subjects prepare students for the way they want to live their lives.

Essay 8: It has long been a controversy amongst students and critics in prospective majors of the sciences and arts to conclude which subjects would be more beneficial to study. While science students claim that its field of study involves intellectual ability, arts students feel that the understanding and study of art is far richer in its importance chiefly in the influence through evolution of human history. While I conclude that a balance in the knowledge of both the subjects are essential, let me lay down my reasons. 
	Science and Math subjects are intellectually rewarding as they teach the understanding of theories that improve human's living standards, such as researches conducted in universities and science laboratories to enhance the lives of human beings with vaccines constantly being researched, produced and tested for incurable diseases. Without such a study, the world be in serious trouble of poor health and living standards. Every theory that is founded would have been tried and tested to prove its success, concluding how the study of science and math subjects requires intellectual capabilities in its challenging field. While it is essential that the study of the sciences and math continue to ensure a healthy living environment, it is also important that a science student receives adequate education in the arts subjects to develop an artistic side of his life. 
	A distinct culture of the arts student is his detailed and subjective approach toward a subject which he has particular interests and talent. It is the beauty of life amidst all the things that could be explained by a science student and a mystery to study. While history had taken place, the study of human evolution is equally beneficial in developing a knowledgeable individual. It helps enhance an individual's life in the ability to appreciate the beauty that life comes bundled in. 
	In conclusion to my opinion, it is essential to have a balance in the study of arts and science subjects as they complement an individual's life with knowledge and facts and the ability to appreciate the beauty of life, with god's gifts of music, literature and art.

Topic 125.	Should study art and music? @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? All students should be required to study art and music in secondary school. Use specific reasons to support your answer.
Essay 1: I agree that all students should be required to study art and music in high school. 'I've read that young children who study art and music in grade school do better in their other studies. That argument aside, we should study art and music for its sake alone. We should study art and music to learn more about ourselves, our culture, and our world. 
	Both art and music feed students' imaginations and help them express themselves. There's a reason our ancestors in caves drew on the walls and made music with drums. Wanting to express ourselves is natural. It gives us an avenue for our emotions and fears. It may not always be music other people want to hear or art others will appreciate, but the activity itself is enjoyable. It shouldn't matter if the end result isn't perfect. In the process, we learn what we like and dislike. 
	Studying art and music means more than drawing or playing an instrument. Students usually go to art galleries and concerts, too. By studying the pictures on the museums' walls or by reading the program notes at a recital, students will learn what society has decided is worthy of praise. They learn what is important in their own culture. 
	Students may also learn about other cultures by looking at art and listening to music from other countries. When they do that, they'll see similarities and differences with their own. They'll learn about what is important in other societies. Students will also learn how the art and music of other cultures affect our own. 
	By studying art and music in high school, students begin to understand themselves as well as their own culture and other cultures. What could have more value than that?
