Topic 126.	Can young people teach older one? @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? There is nothing that young people can teach older people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.
Essay 1: There is much disagreement over whether there is something that young people can teach older people or not. Some people claim that the older know everything better than the younger. Other people, however, argue that the younger can master something that the older do not know. As far as I am concerned, the older can still learn something from the younger even if the former know more than the latter. 
	Why do some people think that the older is more knowledgeable than the younger on anything? The main reason is, people accumulate knowledge from experience day after day, most of which cannot be gained through books. For instance, an old accountant can handle many difficult accounting affairs while a young one cannot because the former has more experience. 
	Although I agree that the older can teach a lot of things to the younger, I insist that it pays for the older to learn something from the younger. In the first place, there is something that the older never know before. The computer is the best example. As we know, the computer was invented in the beginning of 1900's and was becoming popular after the Microsoft Windows operation system was released in 1990's. The older had rare chances to learn and use the computers. On the contrary, the younger begin to get to know the computer very early. No doubt that the younger know computer better than the older. When a person older than 30 years attends a computer course, he/she will not be surprised if the teacher is younger than he/she. 
	In the second place, the younger are more creative and imaginative. When the older do something, they normally follow some rules they got before. It is true the older seldom make mistakes but they also hardly make something new. While, the younger do not have much experience and do not have many restrictions as well. They make mistakes very often but also can make something magnificent. 
	In conclusion, I believe that the older can learn many things from the younger not only because that the younger know more later technologies, but also that the younger have more creative thoughts.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Who says only old people can teach young people? We admit that elder people have much more experiences than our young people, and it is true that they can give us many guidance when we meet problems or unsolved difficulties. However, with the rapid development of a modern society, young people can also teach the elder people a lot. They can update new technologies for the elders, share attitudes towards life with them and bring freshness into their lives. 
	Since living in a very fast developing society, we need to make contact with many new technologies everyday. In other words, we need to learn everyday to keep up with the latest development. For example, computers are now very popular, but we seldom see the elders to use computers. If they can learn how to use them from young people, they will definitely be beneficial from this new machine because computers have brought a lot of changes to our lives and made us experience a different life. Young people are known for their quick understanding and acceptance new things, so I think they can teach the elder about new technologies used in our daily life. 
	The attitudes of young people are totally different from old people. Mostly they are more positive and energetic than old people. They have a different angle to judge something. Sometimes the elders are passive towards life because they went through a lot of frustrations, on the contrary, young people are full of energy towards the life, they are always optimistic even though they met some frustrations. They proudly say because they are young, they can try millions of times. In some degree, young people's attitudes may influence old people. 
	Young people also can share with old people what they like, which may lead a change of old people. As we know, most young people like popular music or even rock-and-role. However, most old people hate that kind of music. But I have an example to show that young people can change an elder: I have a friend who likes Japanese music very well, everyday she plays this music at home. Her grandmother often asks her to stop the music and asks her why she likes them very much. My friend tells her grandmother about the history of Japanese music and shows a lot of clippings. Gradually her grandmother likes Japanese music as well, which made us so surprised. Now if we go to their house, we can see my friend and her grandmother listening Japanese music together and share the feelings as well. You must be surprised like me when you know the story, but it did happen! 
	So, no matter what age group you belong to, we must believe that everyone has something to share with others and to teach others. Old people can give the youngsters lessons and guidance, on the other hand, young people also can teach the elders new things and different ways towards life!
@Notes: 
Essay 3: As is well known, older people have experienced this wonderful world a lot, and they are surely to have acquired much more knowledge about this world than the young people do. Gradually there exists a saying, there is nothing young people can teach older people. But actually I do not appreciate this statement. Young people need to learn a lot from the older people, but it is also reasonable for the older people to keep the pace of this world by the means of communicating with the youngsters due to the rapid evolution of this world. It means the older people also need to get something new from the youngsters. 
	Admittedly, from the standpoint view of philosophy, young people start to learn about everything from both the theoretical books and experiences, then they will grow up in respective way. They will put themselves into this practical world, trying to find and solve new problems. Also many new discoveries and principle will be found by the practice of young people. Only through their practice do this world evolve very rapidly. Thus everybody in this world can share the results of the social development. Otherwise, if no new things were found by the young people, no creative developments would be made, and the society would stop developing. It is not our expectation. It is just these new things that the older people are sure to be lack, so the young people have the responsibility to show the older people what these new things are and how they work. For example, the advanced usage of computer is just the recent result due to the rapid growth of information technology. Many older people do not know how to use the computer, those older people get accustomed to the traditional methods, and refuse to adjust themselves to the new concepts of this computer times. Then young people have the obligation to show those older people how to use the computers, because everybody in this society has right to enjoy the advanced computer technology. 
	In conclusion, on the one hand, young people need to learn a lot from the older people in order to meet the practical needs, on the other hand, the older people also need to communicate with the youngsters. Only in this way can the human being benefit from each other, and the society evolve rapidly eventually.
@Notes: 
Essay 4: Many of us believe that young people have nothing valuable to teach older people. However, that is not always the case. Young people can teach older people about technology, youth culture, and youth-related social issues. 
	Young people are usually better at using new forms of technology than older people. Children these days become familiar with computers at an early age. Older people can learn to use computers from young people. This is true of other technology too. For example, I taught my grandparents how to use a video cassette recorder when I was thirteen years old. They didn't know what it could do until I showed them. Now they use it regularly. 
	Older people are usually not familiar with youth culture, and younger people can help here too. This is important because it can help older people live a more enjoyable life. For example, popular music is generally youth-oriented, and older people don't always listen to it. However, when young people teach them about it, they may come to enjoy it. My grandmother, for example, never listened to popular music before! Introduced her to it. Now she and I listen and dance all the time. I plan to teach her about another piece of youth culture-rollerblading-very soon! 
	Of course, there are more serious issues about which younger people can teach older people. As with computers, today's children have grown up knowing about AIDS and school violence. That is not true for older generations. Here, again, children can teach older people about things that are important to everyone. 
	I know there are people who would say "you can't teach an old dog new tricks." However, it's plain to me that the young have plenty to teach the old if they take the time to try. When they do, I think both gain a new appreciation for each other.

Topic 127.	Reading novels and watching movies @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Reading fiction (such as novels and short stories) is more enjoyable than watching movies. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.
Essay 1: Reading fiction, such as novels and short stories, is more enjoyable than watching a movie. Of course, the images in a movie are much more vivid, because you're seeing them on a large screen in a dark room. The images you "see" in a novel are only as strong as your own imagination. But the more you read, the stronger your imagination becomes. Reading exercises your imaginative powers. Watching a movie dulls them. Imagination, like a muscle, needs to be used. Otherwise it can disappear. 
	When you read, you're an active participant in your own enjoyment. That's one reason reading develops the imagination. You're reading the words on the page and translating them into images in your mind. When you're watching a movie, you're a passive viewer. The movie is giving you everything. Nothing comes from you except your reaction to what you're seeing, and even that can be given you by the movie. Some movie plots are so simple, you can predict what's going to happen before it does. 
	Reading fiction also develops your storytelling skills. The more reading you do, the better you become at creating plots and characters. The plots and characters in movies are often very simple, because the emphasis is on action rather than on language or character development. 
	Still, going to the movies is a great community experience. Sitting in a large theater with a lot of other people is fun. You experience the same reactions to what you're seeing together. Reading is a one-person experience. It's a chance to go into an imaginary world by yourself. Both experiences can be fun and rewarding, but I think reading fiction is more enjoyable.

Topic 128.	Doing exercise every school day @Some people say that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.
Essay 1: Though physical recreations and intellectual activities are two basic ways in which people spend their leisure time. In my opinion, the former is more important for my generation, who is in twenties and is studying hard for their academic achievements. This is based on a consideration of age, our main occupation and the characteristics of two forms of recreation. 
	People of my age are full of energy and physically active, but we have to sit for hours a day racking our brains. We need a complement that can give us more physical exercises and divert our attention from studying. An intellectual activity, like reading a book, playing a chess game can help us escape from the worries and forget our study for a moment. But there is no physical activity, what's more, they are more or less still a form of mental recreation. For instance, we may feel mentally tired after games of chess and our study will be affected. In contrast, a physical recreation can provide us with a lot of physical activities and real mental relaxation. A ballgame, for example, can build up muscles, flex joints, speed up blood circulation and enhance bodily organs. We may feel physically exhausted, but we can be absorbed in study more easily. 
	In the view of above, however, it doesn't mean that one form is "meat" and the other is "poison". Occasionally, when we are physically exhausted and we are in good mood, a chess game or a good TV program can be very helpful.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: While physical exercise is important, I do not believe that it is the school's responsibility to provide physical training for its students. That is something that everyone can take care of on his or her own. 
	Many students get plenty of physical exercise as part of their daily life or recreation. A student who bicycles ten miles to and from school does not need more exercise. A good physical education program must take a student's outside activity into consideration. Otherwise, some students will spend valuable class hours repeating physical exercise. 
	If a school offers such activities, it also suggests that students will be graded on them. The range of possible physical activities is great: football, swimming, weight lifting, ballet, ballroom dance, yoga, skiing, horseback riding, and golf are just a few. However, the number that a school could offer is small. Some students could get bad grades in physical education simply because the school could not provide an activity they enjoy or do well. This seems unfair. Research suggests that participation, not excellence, in these activities determines the physical benefits the body will get. 
	Another issue is economic. Many schools do not have the money to provide gym facilities, playing fields, and athletic equipment for their students. Other schools are located in cities where that kind of space just isn't available. A few schools would rather keep money for academic purposes. 
	Schools can certainly encourage physical activity. They can provide space for notices about activities, events, and classes for physical activities. They can encourage students to plan time away from academic studies to get some exercise. However, I think that providing exercise should not be the school's responsibility.

Topic 129.	A agricultural or business research center? @A university plans to develop a new research center in your country. Some people want a center for business research. Other people want a center for research in agriculture (farming). Which of these two kinds of research centers do you recommend for your country? Use specific reasons in your recommendation.
Essay 1: The importance of agricultural and business research centers cannot be underestimated. Success in farming and success in business each can improve a country's standing. I think that agricultural research tends to improve the quality of individual citizens' lives, whereas successful business practices improve a country's economy in relation to other nations. Choosing between an agricultural and a business research center is a difficult decision. However, I believe that the agricultural research center would be most beneficial because its benefits are more widespread. 
	Business practices in the United States already serve as a model for many other countries. While we certainly have much to learn, the U.S. already has a fairly solid economic basis. Further, businesses are already well-connected internationally. They have the advantage of the Internet and other means of electronic information transmission. I think that a business research centre would really only help a few directly. Businessmen would get richer. For the rest of the country's people, there might be little obvious benefit. 
	On the other hand, an agricultural research centre would help all people. No country can survive without adequate means of food production. While the U.S. is able to produce or import enough food now, that may not remain the case if current trends continue. Natural resources are eroding, and more and more American farms are closing. Farmers need to build stronger networks across the country and internationally, much as businessmen already have done. Ultimately, better systems for farming will help all people. For example, food prices can be reduced as farmers discover more effective means of food production. 
	Morally, I believe that it is best to do what will benefit the most people. I believe that the university's decision to build an agricultural research center could do just that.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Since the announcement of the University's plan to develop a new research center in our country, many people have showed their concern for the project and expressed their views of type of center it should be. It is now clear that the diversified views have converged to two: a business research centre or an agriculture research center. Now that we have to make a decision, I think we should choose the latter without hesitation. 
	As everybody knows, our country is an agricultural country whose farming produce is not enough to feed its own people. We have no way out but to develop our agriculture because agriculture is the foundation of our national economy and because it would be a disaster to the whole world if we rely on foreign food to feed the biggest population in the world. 
	To develop our agriculture, we cannot just call on the peasants to work harder because they have being working the hardest from generation to generation. What we should do is to raise their educational level and provide them with better seeds, more fertilizers, advanced machinery and equipment, and up-to-date technical advises. In short, we have to rely on science and technology to develop our agriculture. 
	Some people would say that this cannot be a convincing reason because science and technology are needed not only in agriculture but also in all other fields. My view is that our situation in agriculture is the most serious and the challenges are the greatest. Ours is a big country with widely different climates and soil conditions. If we are to assist the peasants, we have to study all types of crops and all the farming conditions in this land. With a research centre, these problems can be studied and solved systematically. But so far, no agriculture research center worthy of the name has been set up while there is already a business centre in the southern part of the country. 
	Because of the above reasons, I strongly recommend that we develop a research center for agriculture purpose and I also strongly recommend this center be well funded. If we take this step and succeed in this endeavour, our agricultural produce will be greatly increased and our whole national economy will have a solid foundation.

Topic 130.	Spending much time to play sports @Some young children spend a great amount of their time practicing sports. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: Currently some young children spend a great amount of their time in practicing sports. Most parents feel quite happy because sports are good for their kids' development and team work spirit, however they are quite worried about some negative effects such as practicing sports occupies too much time, distracts their attentions on schoolwork and loses certain interests on other activities. In my opinion, everything has its good side and bad side. The important thing is to handle it properly. 
	Admittedly, practicing sports can help children's physical development, which makes them grow faster and stronger than before. As we know, during children's development periods, especially from 10 to 16 years old, sports are really helpful for children to develop. Sports can create a strong body that reduces the possibility of contracting some diseases easily. Definitely we believe that children benefit from sports. 
	Another good thing is that sports teach us to learn how to corporate with other members in a team. Most sports are team work. If we want to play them well, we must master some skills to care about what our team members are thinking and how to adapt each other to achieve a common goal. Sports are not an individual activity, it needs corporation and mutual understanding. This is not easy to master. Of course, for parents they are delightful to see their children to get this skill from sports. 
	On the other hand, practicing sports seem to occupy too much of children's spare time to concentrate their schoolwork. As a student, one's major task is to study hard and try to learn as much as possible, which needs students to devote much time on study or their spare time. If children devote themselves in practicing sports, it is not denying that they cannot concentrate them on schoolwork at the same time. The consequence of practicing sports too much leads children to distract themselves, which influences their future. 
	Actually, besides sports, there are still many kinds of activities, such as drawing, collecting, good for their developments. If a child is too concentrated on sports, it is inevitable that he will lack of chances to explore other activities and lose some happiness when engaged in different experiences. 
	Overall, on one hand, we should encourage our children to participate in sports activities; on the other hand, we must also remind them not to be too engaged because they should put study at the first place during their school time. There is a limit of doing everything.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Most kids love to play sports. It's important to them, but for the majority, it's just one type of activity out of many that they do. For a small number of kids, though, a sport becomes their whole life. They spend almost all their time and energy practicing. This has both advantages and disadvantages. 
	Sports are good for young children in many ways. Kids who enjoy sports are likely to have better health. They develop good habits of daily exercise that will keep them healthy as adults, too. Today, many children and adults are overweight, but those who love sports stay in shape. Plus, by developing their physical abilities, they will learn how to work hard towards a goal. Their achievements in sports will make them feel good about themselves. They'll also make friends and learn teamwork. Sports, whether a little or a lot, can have positive effects. 
	We admire the talent and dedication of young athletes, but we also wonder if they're losing something. Their focus is very narrow. If they devote most of their time to sports, are they neglecting schoolwork? What about other interests? Children should try out many different activities. In addition, many young athletes are pressured by parents or coaches to succeed. Kids whose drive comes from inside usually do okay, but others can be unhappy and have health and emotional problems. So sports, like anything else in excess, can have negative effects too. 
	When I was young, I liked books and hated sports. I saw other people who loved sports and hated school. Now that I'm older, I've found a better balance. People have to figure out what's right for them. Is there such a thing as too much sports? There is no right answer, because there is no "right amount." Everyone is different.

Topic 131.	Who are successful? @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Only people who earn a lot of money are successful. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: Is it true that only people who earn a lot of money are successful? Recently the controversy has been brought into focus. We cannot deny the fact that money is one of the yardsticks against which how much one has achieved is measured. However, in stark contrast, many people would rather stick to an opposite view. 
	The rhetoric that only when people have earned a colossal sum of money can they be regarded successful is not only unreasonable, unconvincing, or misleading but also absurd and ridiculous in that it has obviously neglected the celebrated scientists, sociologist, psychologists, philosophers and anthropologists who may have never had enough money to live a comfortable and convenient life yet they are virtually successful. For instance, Albert Einstein, The greatest physicist of the 20th century who created the theory of relativity and was awarded the Nobel Prize, was immune to becoming wealthy. 
	Besides, not all wealthy people are successful. A good case in point is that in West China, some farmers cut down millions of trees each year and sell the timber at a high price. As a result, environment has been devastated. Innocent people have to suffer floods and air pollutions. Although the farmers are rich, they are never successful but guilty. 
	Last but not the least, besides money, there exists a diverse array of other calibrations to measure one's achievement. The society awards its members in different ways. As long as one makes contributions to the society, he or she would earn respects. 
	Taking account of all these factors, we may easily reach the conclusion. Undeniably, people who disagree with the statement have a much stronger argument. Besides the wealthy, other people could also be regarded successful.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Nowadays, many people who are living in the material world tend to believe that money is synonymous with success, and thus only people who earn a lot of money are successful. But is it the case? I beg to differ. 
	On one hand, the riches are not necessarily successful. To some extent, we cannot consider an officer who was charged for his abusing his authority for personal gains successful, nor can we call a rich man who was left dying without care, while his sons were quarrelling for bigger share of his legacy a successful person. 
	A person’s success is measured by, as far as I am concerned, a good reputation in the community, a desirable role in the family, and satisfaction which comes from within. 
	On the other hand, not only those who earn a lot of money are successful. Numerous people who are universally deemed to be successful not because they make big bucks. An eastern Orthodoxy sister of great altruism, Mother Theresa threw this eager vitality of hers into a vehement striving after the social welfare of the needy and won the Nobel Prize; Michelangelo achieved immortal with his painting and sculpture, Beethoven with his music. Outside the spotlight, even common civilians live their respective life of success, seldom of which have something to do with large purse. Doctors are respectable with their patients, teachers with their students. 
	It is manifest from the above argument that the proposition” only people who earn a lot of money are successful” is still subjected to serious reconsideration.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Many people believe that a large income equals success. I believe, however, that success is more than how much money you make. Some of those measures of success include fame, respect, and knowledge. 
	Most people assume that famous people are rich people, but that isn't always true. For example, some day I would like to be a famous researcher. Few scientists are rich by today's standards. Still, I will feel myself to be successful if lam well-known. Additionally, there are many famous humanitarians who are not rich. Mother Theresa was one. Certainly, no one would say she was not successful. 
	I also believe that being respected by co-workers indicates success. Without that respect, money means little. For example, I once did some work for a top attorney in a law firm. He made a very good salary, but he wasn't a nice man. No one ever did work for him willingly. He ordered everyone around, and we didn't respect him. In contrast, however, I had a wonderful band director in high school. He had to take extra jobs just to make enough money to support his family. However, his students had great respect for him and always listened to what he said. As a result, we were a very good band. In my opinion, my band director was more successful than the attorney was. 
	Finally, I think one of the most important indicators of success is knowledge. Wealthy people don't know all the answers. For example, in the movie Good Will Hunting, the only person who could solve some complex problems was the janitor. He knew a lot, and decided what he wanted to do with that knowledge rather than just think about money. In my opinion, he was extremely successful. 
	When we think of history, there are few people that we remember simply because they were rich. Overall, we remember people who did something with their lives-they were influential in politics, or contributed to science or art or religion. If history is the ultimate judge of success, then money surely isn't everything.
@Notes: 
Essay 4: Since people's criteria for success differ, there is much debate over whether only those who make a lot of money are successful. As far as I am concerned, in today's society which stresses on individual achievement, money provides the best evaluation of one's accomplishment. 
	To begin with, as a standardized measurement used for comparing values, money is objective rather than subjective, so it is considered an authentic reflection of one's achievement. As different people hold different understandings of success, assessing the amount of one's earnings has become universally accepted as a rule to measure one's success. Each year, Fortune Magazine publishes a special issue to rank the top 100 most successful people throughout the world according to their yearly income, because there is no other methods to rely on. 
	In addition, the amount of money one makes is the consequence of one's hard work and talent. To deny the accomplishment wealth brings is equal to deny the sources from which it springs. In the past, I only believed in spiritual values and then leapt rashly to the conclusion that the best thing in life involves no money at all. It is my uncle who showed me the significance of money and changed my opinion. He told me he respected money and made it a goal to strive for in his way towards success. Because he would have to pay a price for it in terms of time, thought and energy. Gradually, I came to realize it is the mental and physical labour he devotes in the process of making money that paves his way for self-accomplishment, and thus deserves appreciation and respect. 
	Finally, money is the most powerful possession in one's lifetime. As everyone knows, success is the ability to do whatever one wants to and to be satisfied with oneself. There is hardly anything that can be done without a certain amount of money. Indeed, with money, one can meet his or her material demand in life, such as taking effective medicines, living in magnificent houses, eating various delicious food, and so on. Also, with money, one can do a lot of meaningful things to benefit others, such as donations to poor people. All these will not only satisfy one's need for personal fulfilment, but also add grandness to one's success. 
	In conclusion, money serves as a measurement of one's achievement. But we should keep in mind that only those who obtain money by hardworking and use it to benefit the society are really successful.

Topic 132.	If you could invent a new product @If you could invent something new, what product would you develop? Use specific details to explain why this invention is needed.
Essay 1: If I could invent something new, I'd invent a device or pill that could put people to sleep immediately and would have no side effects. The proper amount of sleep is important for our concentration, mental health, and physical health. 
	Getting enough sleep is a vital human need. For one thing, without sleep our concentration is strongly affected. We're easily distracted, we can't remember things, and we don't notice what's happening around us. For example, a lot of car accidents are caused by tired drivers. When we get enough sleep, our powers of concentration are sharper. We're more focused on what we're doing. We perform better. 
	Mental health is also affected by lack of sleep. It's easy to tell if people don't get enough sleep. They're on edge, cranky, and out of sorts. They lose their tempers easily and over-react to situations. In fact, experiments have shown that lack of sleep over a long period of time can cause a complete mental breakdown. When we get our proper rest, we're more alert and responsive. Our outlook is positive, and we're much easier to get along with. 
	Our physical health shows the strain of sleeplessness, too. We have less energy, and everything seems like a major effort. Over a long period of time, we become slow and unresponsive. The wear and tear on the body from lack of sleep can be a very serious health problem. Every doctor will tell you that getting enough sleep is a basic factor in maintaining good health. 
	Wouldn't it be great to go to bed every night knowing you’d have no problem getting to sleep, no matter what's going on in your life? Getting enough sleep is always going to be an important pan of how you respond to your situation. I think this device would be very helpful to all of us.

Essay 2: People will normally invent something that they want very much in the real life if they have the ability. As a father of a two-year-old boy, I would make a baby sitter robot. The reasons are as follows. 
	In the first place, a baby-sitter robot can take care of my baby when I go to work. There will be a dilemma in front of parents when they have a child, who should stay at home and who should continue to work, mother or father? With a baby-sitter robot, they do not need to make a choice. Parents will no longer give up their jobs because of their child. 
	In the second place, a baby-sitter robot can make my baby stay away from danger. A person cannot concentrate on one thing 24 hours a day. It will be dangerous when he/she is taking care of a baby. A baby is so unpredictable that you never know what he/she will do in the next minute. For instance, the baby may swallow a coin or fall to the ground from the bed when you just do not look at him/her for a second. However, a robot does not have such a problem because she is never tired. She can keep an eye on the baby all the time. Any potential dangerous action will be prevented. Even when the baby is sleeping, the robot can still watch the baby if you want. In addition, a baby-sitter robot can entertain the baby. Songs and stories can be inputted in the robot's memory and replayed whenever the baby needs them. It is so easy to change them that the baby will never be bored on one song or story. 
	In conclusion, I would like to invent a baby-sitter robot not only because it can take care of my baby for me, but also because it can make my baby safe and happy.

Topic 133.	A person's childhood years @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A person's childhood years (the time from birth to twelve years of age) are the most important years of a person's life. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: I can't remember how many times when I was informed that a person's childhood years played a rather important role in the whole life; I can't remember how many times especially when a VIP was interviewed by a journalist, he or she, more often than not, would mention his or her childhood years, regardless of its toughness or happiness. Just as the famous poet Word's poem goes, "Child is the father of the man "! So, I think, the several childhood years are the most important years of a person's life both psychologically and physically. 
	The famous psychologist Sigmund Freud had once put great emphasis on the importance of a person's childhood, to put aside the academic debate, I think whether a person spends the crucial couple of childhood years in a happy-go-lucky way has a lot to do with his or her later life psychologically . For example, a child who was maltreated when in his or her childhood may be under the shade in the adult life, which has been proved either experimentally or empirically. As a matter of fact, these examples are defying enumeration. 
	On the other hand, the period of childhood is a very vital stage for the child to grow up physically, because at this special stage, the main organs of the body and their functions begin to develop and become mature gradually and this stage matters a lot regarding laying a sound foundation for the teenage stage and the later adult stage. 
	Thus, we, if as parents, should develop a happy atmosphere for our children to make sure they spend this very special period in a safe and happy way; we, if as children, should live a happy way ourselves. Do remember this several childhood years are the most crucial years of a person's life psychologically and physically!
@Notes: 
Essay 2: I agree that a person's childhood years, from birth until twelve years of age, are the most important. All the information I've read about that time of life states that these are the years that form us. These years determine what kind of a person the child will become. During these years we learn about relationships, begin our formal education, and develop our moral sense of right and wrong. 
	The early years are the time when we learn about relationships. First we learn about our parents and siblings, then about rest of the world. We learn how to respond to others based the treatment we're given. If we're loved, then we know how to love others. If we're treated harshly, we may grow up to treat others harshly. We also form our ideas about our own self-worth from the way others treat us during these years. They can convince us we're worthless, or they can teach us we deserve love and respect. 
	These are the years when we begin our formal education. We acquire the basic skills-reading, writing, working with numbers-which we'll use throughout our lives. We need a good foundation in these subjects. Otherwise, anything we try to do later will be undermined by our lack of skills. Perhaps the most important thing we can learn during these years is how to analyse information and use it. These are skills that will always be useful. 
	Most important, from my point of view, these are the years when we develop our moral sense of what's right and wrong. Others teach us about good and bad, but later in our early years we begin to decide for ourselves. It's also during this time that we begin to develop the self-discipline to live according to our morals. 
	I believe a person grows and changes for the better throughout the many stages of life. However, the foundation is laid in those first few years of life.

Topic 134.	Children and household work @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Children should be required to help with household tasks as soon as they are able to do so. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: In the past in America, children were valuable workers. For example, they helped on the farm or in the family business in order to bring in money. Just a couple of generations later, attitudes have changed. Now children are hardly expected to work at all. Modern children often don't even do household chores. This is sad, because I think that they are missing something if they don't help out at home. Sharing in household tasks benefits children of all ages. 
	First of all, household tasks build skills. Very young children learn motor skills and classification skills when they pick up their toys and put them away. Talking about how to do things helps them learn to analyse situations. Older children learn skills they'll need as an adult. Cleaning and cooking may seem dull, but knowing how to do them well makes life a lot easier. How many young adults leave for college unable to do their own laundry or cook anything besides a frozen microwave dinner? It's amazingly common. 
	When everyone in a family helps out, the family is happier. Nowadays it's common for both parents to work. When they come home, they have more work to do. Life is stressful and there's no time for fun. By sharing household tasks, everyone gains. Children can help their parents with simple tasks such as picking up their own rooms, putting away their own laundry, starting dinner occasionally, or taking care of younger siblings. Then the family can relax together, and parents won't feel like servants to their "couch potato" offspring. 
	The most important thing children learn from helping with household tasks is responsibility. Handling everyday tasks teaches organization and time management skills. Children learn that chores have to be completed before they can play, or before? They get their allowances. Children who understand that effort pays off will be more successful later in life. 
	Kids should not work all the time. A happy life needs balance. But if they can successfully handle tasks at home, they will handle life better too. They will know the satisfaction of doing a good job, be involved in family life, and become more confident and responsible adults.

Topic 135.	Wearing school uniforms @Some high schools require all students to wear school uniforms. Other high schools permit students to decide what to wear to school. Which of these two school policies do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.
Essay 1: Many high schools, both public and private, require students to wear uniforms. I think that such a policy is an excellent idea because uniforms can make things more equal for all Students. 
	First, uniforms make students equal on an economic level. With uniforms, students from poor families dress the same as students from rich families. This can prevent envy and jealousy about stylish clothes. It can also encourage students to form friendships based on personality, not clothes. 
	Second, uniforms can reduce unequal treatment by teachers. Research suggests that teachers often have higher expectations for more attractive students, which include those students with nicer clothes. This special attention can include providing more challenges and opportunities for these students. Uniforms help teachers make judgments based on ability, not appearance. 
	Finally, uniforms encourage the individual students of a school to feel like part of a bigger group. Their feelings of being together, working together and having something in common are all helped by uniforms. 
	It is my opinion that all schools should have a policy requiring uniforms. Uniforms give every student an equal chance.

Topic 136.	When you win a game @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Playing a game is fun only when you win. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: Everyone has the experience of playing games with others. Why we play games? One obvious reason is that we want to relax, to enjoy our life, to have fun. Anyway, some games, including tennis or badminton, will produce the winner and the loser. In my opinion, I disagree that only the winner has got fun. 
	The first and far most reason is that the purpose of playing games is to escape from your boring data, or office to smell flowers. Winning or losing has nothing to do with your fun, because it is not your job, it is just a game. For example, we students have to spend ten to fifteen hours in lab or in reading textbook, when we have a chance to play football with our friends, who will really emphasis on the results. Everyone has got fun. 
	Another reason why I contradict the title statement is that we can learn something useful by playing games. We may take long running as an example. As we know, the last part of long running is hard to stand. Even though you lost the game, you also learn that persistence can lead to victory, which will do well to your career. 
	Finally, some games such as football help shape your body in spite of loss. So, why not depress? 
	Taking into account all of these factors, we may safely arrive at the conclusion that both winning and losing in paly games give us fun.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: I agree with the old saying, "It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game.” I don't need to win. I have fun playing all games because it gives me time to be with friends, learn new things, and work as a team. 
	Tennis is one game that I enjoy. It's a great opportunity to socialize. Of course, you can't carry on a conversation while you're playing, but my tennis partner and I talk a lot before the game. Since we have to reserve a court, we have to talk to one another to find a convenient time to meet. Then we have to make sure that the court is available at that time. This often takes many phone calls and, of course, we talk about many other things during the same conversation. Once we get to the court, we often have to wait. That gives us another opportunity to chat. After the game, we usually go out for a soda or a meal and talk some more. We don't even talk about h6w well or how poorly we played. Tennis is just an excuse for us to get together. 
	The board game Scrabble, on the other hand, is a real skill builder. It's a challenge to form words from the letters in front of you and on the board. I always learn a new word from my opponent, although sometimes I'm suspicious whether the word really exists. Often we don't even keep score. We just do it because its fun and we learn new English words. 
	Soccer is the most competitive sport I'm involved in. I do my best, but it doesn't matter to me if my team loses. I enjoy just being with my friends and traveling to different schools in different cities to play. I learn a lot about teamwork when we practice. Our coach tells us the most important thing is to play well as a team. It seems she just wants us to have fun and not worry about winning. 
	All in all, I just enjoy having a good time. Presumably that's our purpose in life. Isn't that better than worrying about who wins and who loses all the time?
@Notes: 
Essay 3: The statement in the direction is a long term consideration of many people including me. Many people will argue that playing a game is only fun when you win. I, however, after thinking about it on many occasions, decide to stand up against this view for the following reasons. 
	The first and the most important reason for my opposing the idea is that playing a game, no matter you win or lose, helps release a person from the heavy pressure, in most cases, resulted from intellectual activities. There is no better example than myself when I was trying so hard to enter the university. At that time, when I was too exhausted to memorize any single incident in the history book, a play of badminton would refill me with fresh energy to go back to my studies, though I hardly won any of these badminton games as my partner is an excellent player. Therefore, the biggest advantage of playing games lies in the fact that it helps people relaxed. 
	Another reason for my disagreement is that one will find out his or her capacity of making progress while playing a game. When learning a new game, if your opponent is a more mature player than you are, it is for sure that you will not win him or her at the beginning, but in the process of the game, if you are a conscientious player, you will definitely learn to grasp the basic skills of a certain game, which enable you to play better and better. Consequently, the awareness of your ability in learning new things is the best award you can find in game playing. 
	Therefore, I will conclude by saying that playing a game itself is worthwhile and to win or not to win is not a matter to concern since you could get rid of the feeling of exhaustion and confirm your confidence as a learning-capable being.
@Notes: 
Essay 4: Recently, many people argue as if it is a general truth that playing a game is fun only when you win. In various games and matches, the main aim of players from both sides seems to be winning. And winning is not only for the players themselves, but also for the honour of their team, and even for that of their nation. But to be frankly, I cannot agree with them. There are numerous reasons, and I would explore only a few primary ones here. 
	The main problem with this argument is that the real meaning of a game is to enjoy the process of the game; the result, whether it is win or lose, does not seem matter. Think of the original games of our ancestors, the goal is to show their love of sports, their physical strength and celebrating the hunting. And the true intention of their game is for relaxation and amusement. Another good example is that children enjoy playing games more than adults. When we watch children play, we can understand that they are more concentrate on the game itself, and do not care for the result. There are too young to realize the importance of winning the game, therefore they enjoy it more. 
	If the players play a game for winning, they will concentrate on scores too much, and forget to enjoy the game. In this society, everyone want to be winner, for they will not only win the honour, but also win fame, money, and so on. In the same way, the loser will lose everything. It seemed that playing a game become a way to get material comfort, but not fulfillment of spirit. 
	Furthermore, when players play a game for winning, they face the stress from the team, even for the nation, and they struggle to win. Sometimes, players do everything by fair means or foul in order to win. They may use illegal drugs, or bribe the judges. There are various scandals about athlete almost in every international game, and this thing become more and more serious. These are all because the results of games have been linked to money and the honor of a country. 
	General speaking, when you only want to win, you will lose the fun of playing a game. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that, it is wiser to learn to enjoy playing without regard of the result of game.

Essay 5: Recently, many people argue as if it is a general truth that playing a game is fun only when you win. In various games and matches, the main aim of gamers of both side seems to win. And win is not only for the gamer themselves, but also for the honor of their team, and even for that of their nation. But to be frank, I cannot agree with them. In my point of view, the real meaning of game is to gain fun from the procedure of the playing, but not get the result of win or loss. There are numerous reasons why I hold no confidence on them, and I would explore only a few primary ones here. 
	The main problem with this argument is that it is ignorant of the basic fact that playing a game for win will not only make gamer lose the fun, but also result in many things breaking the rule. In this society, everyone want to be winner, for they will not only win the honor, but also win money, house, and so on. In the same way, the loser will lose everything. It is seemed that playing a game become a way to get creature comfort, but not enjoyment of spirit. 
	Furthermore, when game does not only the honor and shame of individual, the gamers facing the stress from the team, even for the nation must struggle for win. For gain their end, many people take any kind of means without regard to whether break the rule of normal or law. There are various scandals about athlete almost in all the international game, and this thing become more and more serious. 
	Another reason why I disagree with the above statement is that I believe that the real meaning of game is to gain fun from the procedure of the playing. When we observe the playing of children, we will find that they are more like the game per se, not care for the result. There are so little adult can realize the joy of the procedure of the playing as a child. On the other hand the original game of our ancestor is comparing the physical strength and celebrating with the hunting. And the true intention of their game is for relaxation and amusement. 
	General speaking, when you only want to win, you will lose the fun of playing a game. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that, it is wiser to learn to enjoy playing without regard of the result of game.
@Notes: 
Topic 137.	Allowing students to choose the subjects @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? High schools should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.
Essay 1: I think high school students should be allowed to choose some of the subjects they study. 
	However, the basic subjects, like mathematics, literature, and science, should be mandatory for all students. 
	When I was in high school, we were allowed to choose three electives each semester. Electives were subjects that weren't part of the bask curriculum. They included things like music, journalism, art, and various kinds of team sports. Choosing some of these subjects to study gave me a chance to experiment. I was able to get a head start on what I was going to study in college. 
	However, college preparation shouldn't be the main factor. I think all students should be allowed to take a certain number of courses just because they're interested in them. For many students, high school is the last chance to learn about things they're interested in. Maybe once they have a job there won't be time for studying. 
	Of course, it's also important that students study certain basic subjects. If I'd had a choice, I know I wouldn't have studied mathematics or science. I wasn't very interested in them. However, once I was in class, I found myself getting interested. I wouldn't have known this if I'd been given the choice, because I would have chosen not to take the courses. 
	High school students aren't always the best judges of what they'll find useful in the years ahead. They need the guidance of experts in the field of education. However, they also need some freedom to follow their curiosity and individual interests. They should be given the freedom to choose some courses, while being required to take others.

Topic 138.	A member or a leader of a group? @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to be a member of a group than to be the leader of a group. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: Maybe in someone's opinion ,to be a member of a group would not have to shoulder some responsibilities ,deal with a variety of persons ,and spend a wealth of time in its daily affairs while the leader have to; but, when taking the beneficial factors into consideration ,compared with the so-called negative aspects mentioned above ,we can safely say that it is better to a leader of a group than to be a member of a group! 
	Of course ,a leader of a group ,is intrinsically a member of the group ,so in this sense ,the leader should answer for the duties a common member should do and also can enjoy the relating rights a common a member can do .Beside as a leader of the group ,he or she should be responsible for many other duties like the management and the development of the group ,and maybe someone takes these obligations as a burden ,but for me ,I think it is an opportunity to full play a leader's talents and potentiality and thus to win the respect as well as trust of the members of the group ;and from this standpoint ,no more beneficial and challenging is than to be a leader of a group . 
	Then as a leader of a group ,he or she will be endowed with more chance to deal with shades of peoples and thus can learn how to get along with them well and also can win a pool of friends ,who maybe of special importance for his or her future . 
	As a matter of fact, there are a good numbers of reasons to support my view, but I think the ones said above are to the point. So my choice is definitely to be a leader.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Which kind of role do you like to play in a group? Some people would like to be an ordinary member, while some others prefer being the leader of a group. For me, I want to challenge myself as the leader of a group. There are at least two reasons for my choice. 
	Firstly, being a leader of group, could have more opportunities to improve all sorts of abilities and skills by dealing with various kinds of issues. Just take my experience as an example, I am responsible for the marketing and business development in my company and there are four subsidiary staff in my department. Since I started to work as a leader of this group, I have developed my ability in leadership, decision making, communication skills, teamwork and negotiation skills etc., which have greatly benefited me. 
	Secondly, being a leader especially being a qualified leader in a group, you can get more chances of personal advancement and gain more satisfaction from your job. In the leader's position, you have to meet and deal with various challenging tasks, by doing it with your staff, you can demonstrate your leadership and succeed in your company. In addition, you will enjoy the happiness and fulfillment that the job has given to you. 
	All in all, for me, being a leader in a group can make my life more splendid and wonderful. I will get different experiences from it.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: According to my opinion, it's always better to be a leader than a follower. True leaders show initiative. They take action and they assume responsibility. A leader makes a decision. Some followers may approve of the decision; others may complain about it. However, these followers all chose to follow, not to lead. They chose not to make a decision. That's how I'm different. I'm not a follower. I want to make the decisions. 
	Good leaders will not react to events, but will anticipate them. A leader will start a plan of action and then will persuade others to follow. For example, a class president at a local college may feel that the relationship between the community and the campus is not a good one. The citizens may feel that the college kids make too much noise on the street, litter public areas, and shop in other communities. A good class president will recognize that the community and the campus depend on one another. The president ' will ask the student body to keep noise down, help clean up the neighborhoods, and work with businesses to attract students. A good leader takes the initiative. 
	Good leaders must be action-oriented. Having taken the initiative, they must see the job through. They have to take charge and lead the followers. They have to motivate and encourage the followers. The followers (in this example, the student body) must understand why good relations with the community are necessary. The followers must be persuaded to do something about it. 
	Good leaders must be ready to accept responsibility. They accept responsibility for their actions as well as those of the followers. In the end, any credit will be shared with the group; any blame will be the leader's fault. The leader who fails is always alone. 
	I enjoy taking the initiative, determining the direction, and being responsible for my actions. I don't want to suffer through other people's stupid decisions. If there are ' going to be stupid ways to do something, let them be mine. Wouldn't you agree?

Topic 139.	The most important room in a house @What do you consider to be the most important room in a house? Why is this room more important to you than any other room? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.
Essay 1: Basically, a house is composed of a living room, a dining room, washrooms, and bedrooms. Even though each room has its valuable features, I fully believe that a bedroom is the most significant one. In this place, I can rest, study and chat. 
	To begin with, a bedroom allows me to recharge my physical and mental batteries. To illustrate, when I am exhausted, I choose to sleep there. With a cozy bad I can gain sufficient energy to work efficiently and effectively. Besides, I can just sit on a couch and read a newspaper and magazine. It makes me relaxed and release my stress. Furthermore, I can meditate or look out at the scenery. These activities can enable me to forget my troubles temporarily. So, I cannot deny that my bedroom is the most appropriate environment to recess. 
	Moreover, to avoid being disturbed, studying in my bedroom is the best choice for me .I can prepare exams, do projects, complete assignments, and review homework in this tiny and quiet room. On top of that, if necessary, I can surf the Internet for relevant information. For example, if I am assigned to make a presentation about "Civil War". I can simply use a search engine like Yahoo or Google to find out "Civil War" and its organ and its historical importance. In this way, I will come up with ideas to organize how to present perfectly. Therefore, without a bedroom I might get distracted while studying. 
	Last but not least, in a bedroom, I can talk to someone through a phone. For instance, I chat with my boyfriend for hours. It would not be easy to chat with him in a public room such as a kitchen or living room. Under these circumstances, I can share my feelings with him. Also, when I am either enlightened or depressed, I can make a phone call to my peers. Thus, communicating with someone in a bedroom papers less embarrassing. 
	Overall, it seems dull to stay in a bedroom. The more time we stick in this spot, the less time we gather without friends and families. Nevertheless, I wholeheartedly think a bedroom plays a significant role in a house because other rooms cannot substitute its characteristics: a better rest room, a quieter study place, and a more private room for chatting.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: What is the most important room in a house, the kitchen, the living room, or the bedroom? Different people have different opinions. From my point of view, I think that the living room is the important room in a house. There are numerous reasons why the living room is more important than the other rooms, and I would explain a few ones. 
	First, in my recollection, the living room remind me of a lot of rosy memory. In the past, our living room was always a center of congregating. All family members sit together here. Sometimes, we watched TV. Other times, we played chess. Our living room was always full of happiness and pleasure. Now I have my own family, I hope that my living room also becomes the source of our family pleasure. 
	In addition, the living room also a place for parties and guests. When our family friends came to visit, we always entertained them in our living room. Sometimes, we even buy some ornaments such as flowers to decorate our living room. The purpose of all of these is to show our sincere welcome to our guests. We always made our living room spotless. If we take our friends to a messy living room, perhaps our friends will not visit us again. Therefore, a living room always plays a very important role in our social actives. 
	In a word, a living room always plays an important role in both our family life and our social activities. Therefore, I think a living room is the most important room in our house.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: The kitchen is my favorite room in a house, because it is where families gather. To me, that is the most important thing. So many of the memories people have of growing up revolve around the kitchen. My childhood memories concern the kitchens in my grandparents' homes. 
	My mother's family lived in a row house in the city. The rooms were all small, and that included the kitchen. In the summertime, when we'd visit, the back door of the house would, be left open. People would be sitting on the back porch and in the kitchen, talking and laughing, while my grandmother made dinner. There was no air-conditioning, but I don't ever remember feeling too hot. There was always a breeze coming through, along with the sounds of traffic and kids playing ball in the street. 
	My father's family lived on a farm in the country, and their house had a huge kitchen with windows on three sides. It seems like the windows were always open and the curtains blowing with the breeze. The main door to the house was almost never used. Everyone came in through the kitchen, and sat at the big table in the middle of the room. When dinner was being prepared, all the women would bustle around, while the men sat at the table talking about farm prices. Sometimes my grandmother wouldn't even sit down during dinner, but would be refilling bowls of food and people's glasses. From outside, we could hear the cows in the field near the house. 
	These two kitchens are the background for some of my happiest memories. From the beginning of time, human beings have gathered together near the fire where the food was being prepared. I hope that never changes.

Topic 140.	Items made by hand or by machine? @Some items (such as clothes or furniture) can be made by hand or by machine. Which do you prefer - items made by hand or items made by machine? Use reasons and specific examples to explain your choice.
Essay 1: Basically, the production of items can be divided into two groups: one is made by hand and the other is made by machine. Some people always ask which one is better, by hand or by machine? For me, both of them have advantages and disadvantages. 
	Items made by hand are delicate and beautiful in an appearance. For example, most of people like Chinese silk made by hand. The reason is that not only the silk is too delicate to use machine to sew, but also a good piece of hand-made silk will make customers feel it likes a master piece in a degree. In addition, when hand-makers do their jobs, they usually devote more energy and time in them, which allows the possibility of pursuing the accuracy to come true. As we know, there still have many ladies to prefer the tailor-made clothes. Why? The reason is very simple because they think only tailors can meet their needs. We can imagine after the tailor sews the piece stitch by stitch, how it is marvelous to be! 
	On the other hand, items made by machine have been widely accepted around the world because of the introduction of the machine. It is highly appraised of fastness and durability. Actually, these two characteristics are basic criterion for products. Suppose that the washing machine is out of work only after one-month use, I believe a user definitely feels angry and irritating about the bad quality of this washing machine. In some degrees, we can make sure of the quality made by machine. Furthermore, by machine, people can save time. I don't believe any manufacturers will make furniture by hand at most time. Although this does happen in some cases, they are very special. Furniture made by machine can be sold to customers as soon as possible, which increases company's profit through fast moving. 
	However, I agree some advantages about items made by hand and made by machine, there are still have some disadvantages we cannot ignore as well. For items made by hand, it usually takes a quite long time to finish and the cost is accompanied to be very high; for items made by machine, it sometimes is quite rough and not ideal as what users expect. 
	In view of advantages and disadvantages I mentioned above, I suggest we should see what items we are going to buy first, then decide to choose them made by hand or by machine. If I were a customer, I would prefer choosing clothes made by hand and some furniture by machine. In a short, it is unwise to say which one is better in an arbitrary way.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: From my point of view, there are many factors affecting whether to choose an item made by hand or by machine. The main factor to make a judgment is whether we use the item for our daily life or for collection and decoration purposes. 
	For items used in our daily life, the choices we make depend on the following factors: function, form, and price. Function is the most important thing for us. If a product is beautiful, but it is not able to perform the function, it can only be called a decoration, or a piece of garbage. For example, when we buy a TV, what we really care about first it is the quality of the picture and sound, how many stations it can receive, and whether it can be connected easily to the VCR and DVD player at home. The second factor which affects our choice of a product for daily use is its form. Is the TV too big, too small, or too ugly? Will it fit into the living room? Will it be compatible with the colors of other appliances and the furniture? The third factor we may consider is the price. Even if we are very happy with the item, there is no meaning if we cannot afford it. 
	So, in our daily life, there is really no difference whether our clothes or furniture are made by hand or made by machine. It just doesn’t matter as long as they can perform their function. For items for collection and decoration, it is a completely different story. Ancient tools and historical artifacts have more market and educational value than modern day massively produced products, and traditional handicrafts make good tourist souvenirs and beautiful decoration for the house. Therefore, when it comes to items for collection and decoration, I would definitely choose items made by hand, because they are just so special. 
	In conclusion, depending on different items and different uses, I will make different choices.

Topic 141.	Make a change in your school @If you could make one important change in a school that you attended, what change would you make? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: Most of the schools that I attended had excellent programs and instructors. Unfortunately, at one school this was not the case. The foreign language program there needed both better planning and better instructors. If I could, I would make changes in three major areas. 
	The first step would be to offer third and fourth year language classes. This particular school had no language programs above the second year level. Students who started language classes in the first year ran out of classes to take by the time they were halfway through the school. This was frustrating for those of us who loved learning languages. It also had bad effects when we tried to resume language studies in college after a two-year break. 
	Next, the foreign language program should be staffed with well-trained instructors. The current teachers in the program don't speak the languages well enough. In our classes teachers frequently made errors which the students repeated. If the teachers were well-trained, they would be good models for the students. 
	Finally, the materials in the language courses should be updated. They need to use modern technology. Even though the school has a computer laboratory, our language class never used it. We were limited to using the 'assigned textbook. If software was available, the students could search the Internet for current, real-life materials, such as newspapers from other countries. 
	Understanding people from other countries depends on being able to communicate with them. Poor language instruction makes this impossible. Improving the foreign language program would really make a difference to the students of the school.

Topic 142.	What gift would help a child develop? @A gift (such as a camera, a soccer ball, or an animal) can contribute to a child's development. What gift would you give to help a child develop? Why? Use reasons and specific examples to support your choice.
Essay 1: To enhance children's development, some parents select a fairy tale book as a gift; others choose a stuffed doll; still others pick a basketball up. Although every item has its value, personally I find a stereo advantageous for a child's growth to lean languages, music, and communication. 
	First, children can gain knowledge through language cassettes. For example, while listening to tapes of beginner English, children follow the directions to speak out simple words such as "A" means “Apple", "B" refers to “Bird" and "C" defines "Cat". With a "Rewind" button, children can repeat these basic vocabulary as many times as they want. Under these circumstances, repeated stimulation enables them to memorize quickly. So, a stereo can benefit children to study languages effectively. 
	Another contribution of a stereo for children's development is that children can learn the rhythm, melody and lyrics. Like "Elephants", the famous song tells kids why an elephant has a long trunk. Also, according to various rhythm, children can express feelings in different ways. To illustrate, romantic music like Celine Dion's " My heart with go on" has smooth and slow pace. It makes the listener tranquil. However, pop music like Michel Jackson’s "Thriller" thrills children. So, music inspires children's minds. 
	Most importantly, a stereo allows children to communicate with hosts of broadcasts. For example, they can turn into talk show on 99.1 FM. There is a program called “Take a guess" at 9:00am on weekdays. Usually, the host asks questions like "what is the largest animal in the world?" Every child can respond through a phone. If someone gets the wrong answers, the host would provide more hints and clues to children until they get the right answers. In this way, children can improve their imagination and creatively; in addition, they learn how to communicate with others. 
	All in all, little kids can feel frustrated playing tapes and CD's. Also, impatient children cannot stick with hour long or more cassettes. Nevertheless, I strongly think a stereo is worthwhile for children's development because it helps them become gifted in language, music and speech.

Essay 2: When I was about 10 years old, my older sister gave me a present. It was my first real grown-up bicycle: a three-speed, yellow and black, shiny and new. I still remember how excited I was. That bicycle was very important to me over the next few years. If I wanted to give a gift that would contribute to a child's development, I would choose a bicycle. 
	Bikes are great exercise. They encourage outdoor play. Television and video games, which are the most popular children's activities nowadays, involve mostly sitting and staring. Riding a bike makes exercise fun. 
	Bikes are convenient transportation, too. Without a bike you have to depend on an adult to drive you almost everywhere. With a bike you can go farther. You can ride to your friends' houses. If your school is close enough, you can take yourself to school. You have control over where you go, and you’re not always waiting or begging for a ride. Now you can say "Can I go…?" instead of "Please take me!" 
	To me as a child, a bicycle meant independence. Not only could I go farther, but no one was watching where I went. The road went past the park, the pond, the woods, the 7-11 store, and more. I saw the network of little neighborhood roads from a different viewpoint. Everything was much more interesting up close than it was through a car window. I could stop anywhere and look at whatever I wanted. Everything was my choice. Bike riding was active, not passive. 
	My bicycle gave me fun exercise, easy transportation, and freedom. For all these reasons, I think that a bicycle is a special present for a child.

Topic 143.	One long or short vacation? @Some people believe that students should be given one long vacation each year. Others believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.
Essay 1: I like the idea of students having several short vacations throughout the year. I'm a working parent with two school-age children. Every summer I have to come up with a plan for keeping my children safe and entertained for three months, while my husband and I are at work. Summer camps are expensive, and finding the one your children will enjoy can be a challenge. Getting rid of that one long vacation would make life a lot easier. 
	Having several shorter vacations would also make it easier to schedule vacations. My husband and I both work in small offices with other working parents. All of us need vacation time during the same three months. This is hard on our businesses and our careers. 
	We also find that wherever we go in the summer, it's crowded. It would be nice to go places throughout the year and find smaller crowds. I'm sure the attractions themselves would like that better, too. It would be better for the economy to spread things out, too. 
	I think my children would be more focused on their studies if their vacation time was divided up throughout the year. The final month of the school year, they're just not paying attention. They've been in School for nine long months and they don't have a lot of energy. Plus, they're anticipating vacation time. If vacations were throughout the year, they would concentrate better on studies. 
	Of course, many older school buildings aren't air-conditioned, because usually people aren't there during the hottest months. That might be a problem. I think, though, that new air-conditioning would be worth the cost. During the last few weeks of summer, my children are bored with their long vacation. I doubt that would happen if there were several vacations throughout the year.

Essay 2: Hello, friends! As students, what period is your happiest days? - Holidays! I think everyone will agree with this answer, so do I. But what kind of holiday do you like better - the longer one or several short vacations in a year? I think each of them has its advantages and disadvantages. As for me, I like the latter one. 
	Now, let's look at the good and bad points of the two kinds of holidays. Of course, I'd like to begin the topic with my favorite one - short period of vacations. Fist, short vacations are a great relaxation after busy final exams. When we finish the exams, we know that we'll have a month to think freely, to do other things besides classes, to visit friends, to be with our family, to go to concerts, to watch sports contests, and so on. Second, we can plan to travel during the short vacations. In spring, we can go to mountains, to see the various flowers that can't be seen in cities, to see the stream flowing, to climb the mountains, and to appreciate the beautiful scenery on the summit! What a wonderful picture, especially for we students always swimming in the "sea" of books! And in summer, we can go to the seashore to enjoy the sunshine and long beach. In winter, we may go to see the snow scenery! It gives us a lot of pleasure. At last, the most important one is that we will not forget classes after the short vacations. The shortcoming is that, for those students who want to make some money to cover their school expenses, the vacations are too short for them to make enough money. 
	As for the longer vacations, we can have a longer relaxation, we can have a longer relaxation, we can go to remote areas or go abroad to travel. But if we only have one long vacation for a year, isn't it dull for us? And we also may forget some of our lessons after we return to school. From the above, I think the short period of vacations have a lot of advantages comparing with the longer ones. So why not join us in short holidays and enjoy everything we'd like to do!

Topic 144.	A traditional or modern house? @Would you prefer to live in a traditional house or in a modern apartment building? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.
Essay 1: I know there are advantages to living in a modern apartment, but I'd prefer to live in a traditional house. My main reason is that I love traditional design. It's graceful and warm and inviting. I think modern design is very empty and sterile and not very inviting. So, because of the way it looks, I'd choose a traditional house. 
	I recognize the fact that a modern apartment is going to be in much better shape. Being new probably means all the plumbing works, the roof isn't going to leak, the windows are properly sealed, and the kitchen appliances are in working order. A traditional house can't guarantee any of that. In fact, it's likely that things will break down or need replacement, simply because of age. 
	Still, if the appliances are old, so is the wood, and that's a big advantage as far as I'm concerned. Very few new buildings have the kind of beautiful woods that were used years ago. It's something that can't be copied. 
	Space is always important to me, too. I need a lot of room for my home office, my clothes, and to display all the knickknacks I've picked up in my travels. I also like to have interesting space. I don't want all the rooms and windows the same size or a boxy design. A modern apartment usually comes in one size and shape. A traditional house is going to have a variety of spaces where I can put a little table or a window seat. And it will have lots of room, from basement to attic. These are all good reasons for me to prefer living in a traditional house. 
	Some people love modern design, but it's not for me. The space and beauty of a traditional home are more important to me than having everything new and perfect.

Topic 145.	The benefits of advertising for us @Some people say that advertising encourages us to buy things that we really do not need. Others say that advertisements tell us about new products that may improve our lives. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: The whole point of advertising is to encourage us to buy things we don't need. Advertisers are in the business of making money for themselves and their clients. If they manage to sell us something that's good for us too, that's fine. But their primary goal is profit. 
	It begins when we're children. Saturday morning children's television is full of commercials. Over and over again, children see images of toys and games. They see other children who are having the time of their lives. They watch these children and get the message that if they want to have that much fun, they need to buy those things. Thus, at a very early age, we're introduced to two ideas: that we want to be like everyone else, and we want to have what everyone else has. 
	This continues throughout our lives. We spend a lot of our money trying to keep up with our neighbors. We buy the latest model cars, have all the latest gadgets in our homes, and live a lifestyle beyond our budgets. Advertising encourages us to define ourselves by what we own rather than by who we are. It encourages a competition of false values and shallow measurements of what matters in our-lives. 
	Advertising can be damaging. However, it is also one of the ways in which our economy keeps growing. People need to buy products in order for other people to have jobs manufacturing, transporting and selling those products. Advertising also keeps us informed about new products that may actually help us in some way. For these reasons, you could say advertising is a necessary evil.

Topic 146.	Being outside or inside in your free time? @Some people prefer to spend their free time outdoors. Other people prefer to spend their leisure time indoors. Would you prefer to be outside or would you prefer to be inside for your leisure activities? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your choice.
Essay 1: If I had to choose where to spend my leisure time, I'd rather spend it outdoors. I spend all my working hours inside at a desk. When I have some free time, I want to completely change my environment. Getting outdoors gives me a new perspective and helps clear my mind. 
	Being outdoors gives me the opportunity to try new things, see new sights, and meet new people. Staying indoors means reading a book or watching television. Sometimes it involves visiting with friends. Those are all relatively inactive. Being outdoors means a chance to stretch my mental and physical muscles. I can go hiking in an area I've never been before. I can go swimming or rafting on the river. I can go on a nature walk with a ranger and learn about flowers and trees. I can visit all the outdoor monuments in my city that I've never seen before. In each case, I'm doing something that helps me relax while also enjoying the excitement of something new. 
	Of course, weather is a factor. I have a hard time functioning in extremely hot or cold weather and like to stay indoors when it's below freezing or the heat is scorching. At times like that, it's fun to sit inside with a good book or a good friend looking out at the weather and enjoying the comforts of home. But if the weather cooperates, it's fun to read that book outside on a park bench or go swimming with that friend. 
	Enjoying leisure time outdoors can also mean making new friends. Getting outside my own environment gives me the opportunity to meet new people. All in all, leisure time is better when it's spent with Mother Nature rather than a television set.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: People would show different preference to indoor activities and outdoor activities. Some may be interested in spending their leisure time indoors, while others may be fond of the latter. As far as I am concerned, I would always prefer to be outside for my leisure activities. 
	In the first place, outdoor activities can provide me a pure natural environment in which I will feel more relaxed and refreshing. For example, I can always feel regenerated only after one-hour jogging along a quiet street, with the fresh cool air and hammy wind around. Moreover, it is a real fun to travel and enjoy so many wonderful sightseeing in different places. During their vacation, most people would choose to travel to enjoy a period of leisure time so that they can refocus on their studies and businesses. 
	In the second place, participating in varied outdoor activities can help us increase knowledge through our own experience and widen our horizon. As a famous Chinese saying goes: to become wiser, you need to not only read 10 thousand books but also travel 10 thousand miles. It is true when we go out we have the chance to meet different people and different things, which cannot happen if you stay indoors. We chat with people and exchange ideas, we visit many places and learn different cultures, all of which can let us know more about a true world. 
	In conclusion, I personally prefer outdoor activities to indoor ones not only because I can enjoy the relaxation and refreshment in the nature but also through participating in varied out activities, I gain valuable opportunities to convert theoretical knowledge from books into a kind of real experience.

Topic 147.	The best way for schools to spend money? @Your school has received a gift of money. What do you think is the best way for your school to spend this money? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.
Essay 1: A gift of money is generous and welcomed at our school. There are many things that my school could use. To decide, one must consider the amount of the gift and understand that it is a one-time thing. Keeping this in mind, I think that my school could most benefit from new classroom fixtures. 
	If you looked at our school, you would agree that nearly all of the classrooms could use new desks, chairs, chalkboards, bookshelves and cabinets. Our school is old and the people who live here aren't very wealthy. New equipment would provide students with the tools that they need to learn. It is hard to write papers if there aren't enough desks and chairs. It is hard to learn when the blackboards are so old that they can't be erased properly. It is also difficult to organize school supplies without proper bookshelves and cabinets. 
	Another plus that new equipment would provide is that it would make the school more attractive to the community. It is hard for a community to be proud of a school that is falling apart. If the community felt that our school was important, perhaps others would give more money in the future. That would allow us to further improve our school. In addition, maybe community members would feel encouraged to come and help out in the school. That would make it even better. 
	Students would be happier with new equipment. It would make them want to come to school and learn. There would be fewer dropouts. By continuing in their education, these students will be able to better contribute to our community in the future-perhaps even becoming future schoolteachers. 
	While there are many things that can be purchased with a gift of money at our school, I believe that new equipment is the best choice. New equipment would improve the learning environment, the community's attitude, and the students' feelings about their school.

Topic 148.	Is playing games teach us about life? @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Playing games teaches us about life. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: Almost everyone, from little children to adults, loves games. The types of games may change and get more complex as we grow up, but our enjoyment never changes. Playing games is both fun and useful, because games teach us the skills we need in life. 
	First of all, playing games teaches us that everything we do causes something else to happen. If we hit a ball, it will land somewhere or someone will try to catch it. If we make certain combinations with cards, we'll earn points. So when we play a game, we learn there is always a cause/effect relationship. We learn to pay attention to what's happening around us and see how people react to what we do. 
	Playing games also teaches us how to deal with other people. We learn about teamwork, if the game has teams. We learn how to assign tasks according to each person's skills. We learn how to get people to do what we want, and we learn that sometimes we have to do what other people want. 
	Game playing teaches us how to follow rules to achieve something. In a game, the rules have been worked out in advance and make the game go more smoothly. We find out that if we want to reach a goal, we need to know the rules. We learn how to go step by step towards a desired end. We also learn how to make adjustments when things change. We learn how to devise a plan for reaching our goal. We learn strategy. 
	Most people understand that "all work and no play" is bad for you. Learning all these things would be much slower if we didn't play games. Life would be much duller, too.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Nowadays, some people hold the opinion that games teach peoples about life, but others have a negative attitude. And they think that only children play game, so game is only for amusement, and is nothing with the true life. As far as I am concerned, I agree the first statement. There are numerous reasons why I hold on, and I would explore only a few primary ones here. 
	The main reason for my propensity is I believe that the procedure of playing teach people the rulers of games similar to that of society. We can discover when children play games, they often imitate to do the things that occur in the society of adult. For examples, boys and girls like to act as father and mother of family, doctors and patients, teachers and students. These kind of games will make children begin to study to how to deal with things and how to get alone with other persons. And there are the other kind of games such as chess which can developed their intelligence. Like the lesson in the school, these games teach them the other kind of rulers, the method of study knowledge. 
	Another reason can see by every persons is that like life itself, game is full of intense and attracted competition? Everyone can experience the joy of win and the pain of lost from game. In the form of playing game, people would realize what is the competition, how to take on the stress and how resolve problems. And those are very helpful for them in the future work and live. In addition, game tell us that only making great efforts, one can get the desired result. There is an old saying, no pains, no gains. No matter the game is simple or complex, if you want to win, firstly, you should treat it seriously, and then cast about various meanings to resolve the problem. In this way, you can learn how to deal with things and how to cope with difficulties in the society. 
	General speaking, game tell us the principle and truth of life, and people can learn from game how to deal with problem, how to take on the duty and experience the life in the society. Taking into account of all these, we may reach the conclusion that, games teach peoples about life, and people can learn many knowledge from that.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Playing games has always been thought to be important to the development of well-balanced and creative children; however, what part, if any, they should play in the lives of adults has never been researched that deeply. I believe that playing games is every bit as important for adults as for children. Not only is taking time out to play games with our children and other adults valuable to building interpersonal relationships but is also a wonderful way to release built up tension. 
	There's nothing my husband enjoys more after a hard day of work than to come home and play a game of Chess with someone. This enables him to unwind from the day's activities and to discuss the highs and lows of the day in a non-threatening, kick back environment. One of my most memorable wedding gifts, a Backgammon set, was received by a close friend. I asked him why in the world he had given us such a gift. He replied that he felt that an important aspect of marriage was for a couple to never quit playing games together. Over the years, as I have come to purchase and play, with other couples & co-workers, many games like: Monopoly, Chutes & Ladders, Mastermind, Dweebs, Geeks & Weirdos, etc. I can reflect on the integral part they have played in our weekends and our "shut-off the T.V. and do something more stimulating" weeks. They have enriched my life and made it more interesting. Sadly, many adults forget that games even exist and have put them away in the cupboards, forgotten until the grandchildren come over. 
	All too often, adults get so caught up in working to pay the bills and keeping up with the 
	"Joneses'" that they neglect to harness the fun in life; the fun that can be the reward of enjoying a relaxing game with another person. It has been said that "man is that he might have joy" but all too often we skate through life without much of it. Playing games allows us to: relax, learn something new and stimulating, interact with people on a different more comfortable level, and to enjoy non-threatening competition. For these reasons, adults should place a higher priority on playing games in their lives.

Topic 149.	How would you use your land? @Imagine that you have received some land to use as you wish. How would you use this land? Use specific details to explain your answer.
Essay 1: Having some free land has always been a deep wish of mine. When I was a child my family and I often went to the country on weekends, because one of Dad's brothers owned a piece of land none too far from the city where we lived. 
	I enjoyed myself riding horses, playing with cats and dogs, picking up eggs from hens, looking at rabbits, watching birds, and “driving" tractors and so on. Since then, I have been dreaming to have some free land of my own property, in order to do what I most like without annoying any neighbours. 
	First of all I would fill it with trees, flowers and grass, because I love to stay outside and have walks under the trees' shadow. 
	Secondly, I would buy some German Sheepdogs. Actually I'm very fond of this race of dogs and I wish to grow up some exemplars and win premiums at dog competitions. Dogs are the real passion of my life. I love to stay with dogs and speak to them and teach them some basic things. Finally, in order to stay there always, I would build a small country house, made of stone and wood but with all comforts and a swimming pool to bathe in when it's very hot. 
	Probably it's a dream, but don't say it's impossible to accomplish. In fact, I would only need to work in some place neither too near, not too far from the country. There I could find some free land and do what I've just said. So I would realize the child's atmosphere that I can only remember now and that is so distensile when just thinking of it.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: What should I do if someday I had some land of myself? I take it as a serious question although if it is just a hypothesis. While, definitely, I will facilitate it to build up a public school! The reason is that education is so important to both this society and individuals. It is my dream to develop a school for the children who have been bereft the opportunity of acceptance education. 
	Firstly, widely well-educated population can benefit the society they are in from enjoying an orderly circumstance. It is a common sense that intellectuals are more conformable than the others. Bandits or brigands are usually composed of those uncivilized people. With their knowledge, people are much more positively to comply with their national laws. Caution are also be taken by those knowledgeable people to stay away from criminal. 
	Secondly, our society needs to be constructed by their civilian with their technique or skills much more than just their nature strength. It is the advantaged technology that makes a nation standing in the first line among the world. 
	Thirdly, individual in this earth should be equal with all rights including being educated. What tragedy it is that so many kids abandoned or are abandoning their study for their poverty. So many films about these poor children always made me in tears! I swear if only I have the power I will do my best to help them other than just donate those little faint money! 
	If I have some land, I will open a school, definitely!
@Notes: 
Essay 3: If I have received some land to use as I wish, I would use this land to build a library. I like to use the following reasons to explain my choice. 
	The first and most important reason is that library can bring plenty of knowledge to people. I remember the famous words that knowledge is power. Apparently, a library is the ideal place for people to attain knowledge. In a library, we can get all kinds of valuable information that we need, such as knowledge of geography, history, music and politic, and so on. We can imagine that it is so comfortable and enjoyable when we sit in a quiet library and immerse in the world of knowledge that we cherish. 
	Another equally important reason is that people can spend their spare time in a more meaningful way in a library. Now the life pace is faster and faster, so people, especially young people, like to go to see a movie, or a disco party. In comparison with those places, I think that library can provide a quiet and comfortable atmosphere for people who want to reduce the pressure of life. Moving on to wider themes, a library is a good and safe place for children. Parents would rather let their children go to the library frequently than see their child spend lots of time in playing the game or watching television. After all, a good book can provide children with enormous help in their future life. 
	From what has been discussed above, I may safely draw the conclusion that using this land to build the library for people will be my first choice.

Essay 4: The world is becoming increasingly smaller and smaller. The world’s population is now at six billion. The world cities are getting larger and larger. At least two cities, Mexico City and Sao Paulo have almost 30 million inhabitants. In this context, one could say that a gift of land is the greatest gift of all. Land is perhaps the most permanent thing in the world. Unlike diamonds, which really have little value in and of themselves, land actually has great value. Unlike televisions and cars, land cannot be destroyed—if you remove land, there is still more land under it. In this context, I will discuss what I would do were I given some land as a gift. It will be necessary, however, to discuss four things first: First, it is necessary to establish the size of the land. Second, we need to know where the land is. Third, the topography of the land is important. Finally, the weather in the location is fundamental. 
	For the purposes of this essay, I will assume that I have received a rather large parcel of land (it is a gift, right?!) in a temperate climate with four seasons. I will assume that the land is fairly flat. Most importantly, I will assume that this land is mine and that I have control over the land, i.e., that no other government controls the land. 
	Having grown up in a rather poor family, I think I would be quite excited about receiving some land. I have never owned anything of any great value and to own some land would be a wonderful thing for me. For a long time, it has been a dream of mine to be able to build a beautiful house for my mother. My mother is still living in poverty and it saddens me to think of her living in that situation. She often does not have enough money to use the heat in the wintertime and cannot afford to buy new clothes. I would love to be able to give her the gift of a house and a happy place to live for the rest of her life. Since we lived in a country with very cold winters, my family often felt very cold. I would love to bring my mother to a warm place to spend the rest of her days. 
	However, I would not devote all of the land to houses for my family. I would use most of the land to develop a business. In my case, doing this would be very important since I grew up poor. I would need to ensure that I would have a source of income and a way to sustain the activities on the land. An efficient way to do this would be to develop the land in some way suitable to the land. In this case, I would use the land to develop a language and confidence training camp. It has long been my dream to build a perfect language learning center - a place where people could go to learn a language, to immerse themselves in the language, to meet other people and to have fun while doing so. In conclusion, I would like to make one more point. I must admit that I feel somewhat guilty about the idea of accepting such a gift of land. There is a part of me that is somewhat idealistic and would like to think that the world is a beautiful place and that all humans should live together peacefully. From this viewpoint, I would say that no one can own land. As an American Indian once said, "Own the land? You might as well own the air or the sky!" However, this idea is inconsistent with the world today. Being more realistic, I would do what I detailed above.
@Notes: 
Essay 5: Land is a valuable resource, and it is important to use it effectively. I think it would be most effective to create something that all people can enjoy. I therefore propose to use the land to build a campground. At the present time, there is little low-cost recreation in the area where I live. Building a campground would change that. Ultimately a campground would make a more enjoyable environment for everyone. 
	Local entertainment is simply too expensive. A nice evening out can cost as much as one hundred dollars. Even movies and other less expensive types of entertainment are no longer cheap. Further, there are no real recreational facilities nearby. There are no parks within 30 miles. There are very few basketball courts, and most of those are in poor condition. 
	Building a campground could change all that. Staying overnight at a campground is very inexpensive. It can cost as little as thirty dollars. Further, there would be a sports area and picnic tables for use by campers and also those who do not wish to stay overnight. A campground would provide a lot of activities for very little money. That would definitely improve this area. 
	The result of building a campground will be that many more people will be able to afford an enjoyable evening out. A campground also promotes healthy living. People can get out and breathe fresh air. They can walk and hike and play basketball or other sports. That is certainly better than spending an evening sitting down, eating buttery popcorn in a movie theatre. 
	A campground will make the area beautiful as well as functional. We have many wonderful natural resources, but we need to cultivate them. In addition to all the other good things it can bring, building a campground will help us do just that.

Essay 1: Television has increased the speed at which news travels and it can bring situations and images into our homes that previous generations would not have had the opportunity or regret to witness. 
	Television is commonly criticized as being bad for children that an important fact sometimes gets overlooked. In my personal opinion some types of television viewing may actually enhance children's intellectual development. 
	Television contains an enormous variety of forms and content. The effects of television viewing depend on program content and genre. According to a research, young children who spent a few hours a week watching educational programs such as Sesame Street, Mister Rogers' 
	Neighborhood, Reading Rainbow, Captain Kangaroo, Mr. Wizard's World and 3-2-1 Contact had higher academic test scores 3 years later than those who didn't watch educational programs. On the other hand, children who watched many hours of entertainment programs and cartoons had lower test scores than those who watched fewer hours of such programs. Good educational programs can provide lasting benefits to children. 
	Children are most likely to become actively engaged with television content that is neither too easy nor too difficult to comprehend, that is, content that provides some challenges, but also allows a child to gain a sense of mastery. Just like our muscles, the brain gets stronger when it is used, and atrophies when it isn't used. It seems that lack of use also leaves it vulnerable to degeneration later in life.
