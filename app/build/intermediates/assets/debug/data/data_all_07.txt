Topic 151.	The most important animal in your country @What is the most important animal in your country? Why is the animal important? Use reasons and specific details to explain your answer.
Essay 1: In the United States there are many important animals. They help us in a wide range of ways from food production to scientific research. An animal that is not only helpful to us but close to us emotionally is the dog. That is why I feel that dogs are the most important animal in my country. 
	Dogs provide a very important chance to learn or maintain social skills. Children who have dogs learn responsibility white caring for them. Dogs also help older people: The elderly often feel lonely as they get older and have fewer living friends and relatives. They are able to maintain a positive outlook and to feel needed because they are caring for a dog that needs them. 
	In addition to social benefits, dogs also provide some very important assistance. Seeing-eye dogs help the blind live fulfilling, fully mobile lives. Dogs that act as shepherds on small farms are also very helpful. Lost animals mean lost money for farmers, and that can mean going out of business. Police dogs help find illegal drugs, catch criminals, and protect their handlers. Dogs' intelligence and desire to please people made them ideal for all kinds of work. 
	Finally, dogs can save lives. Dogs have been known to find lost children. In extremely cold conditions, they have provided them with life-saving warmth. Dogs have alerted people to fires and other dangers. And we cannot forget guard dogs, which save many owners' lives and property each year by scaring off potential burglars. 
	Again, there are many useful animals in the United States. In terms of the numerous ways in which they can be helpful, however, I believe the dog is the most significant.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Before I answer this question, I feel that I should introduce myself. I come from China, so I think that the pig should be the most important animal in our country because this animal plays a very significant action in our daily life. 
	Needless to say, the pig is one of the most important meat foods. Everyday, we eat it from its head to its feet. All parts of a pig are edible. We can use its different parts to cook all kinds of delicious food. In China, there are eight kinds of dish party. Every kind is closely associated with the pork. 
	The second, the pig is also a kind of important industrial material. We can use the pig skin to make all sorts of shoes, wallets and other leather goods. In addition, its feather can be used to make brushes. 
	The last reason is that raising pig is one of the important income sources of farmers. If you have a chance to China, you can find that almost every farmer family raises several pigs. Many farmers get their cash by selling pigs. At the same time, some provident and skilled farmers have become very wealthy through raising pig. 
	After understanding the reasoning above, I think that nobody should doubt my answer about this question. The pig is really the most important animal in our country.

Topic 152.	Why are natural resources need to be saved? @Many parts of the world are losing important natural resources, such as forests, animals, or clean water. Choose one resource that is disappearing and explain why it needs to be saved. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.
Essay 1: Many natural resources are disappearing or being wasted on our planet every day. One of the most important resources we are abusing is our trees. Each year, hundreds of thousands of acres of trees disappear in countries all around the world. In some countries, these trees are used for fuel. In other countries, trees are destroyed to build housing developments and shopping centers. Saving trees has become a major cultural and economic issue in many areas of the world. 
	Trees are essential to our survival. They are a major part of the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process in which green plants use carbon dioxide to produce oxygen, and oxygen is something all of us need. The fewer trees there are, the more this affects our ability to breathe. 
	Trees are also important in the development of many medicines. The mainstream medical establishment did not recognize this for many years. However, those who use natural medicines have always known how important trees are. Now scientists are agreeing with them. Many drugs come from the leaves of certain trees, along with other herbs and plants. 
	In rural areas, farmers have always known how important trees are to soil conservation. This is why you'll usually see trees lining a field. Tree roots help keep the soil in place, and are also a factor in water distribution deep beneath the ground. 
	Finally, we should save trees from disappearing because they provide so much pleasure. "I think that I shall never see a poem as lovely as a tree," wrote a poet. That is the truth. A tall, stately tree is beautiful to look at, and pleasing to the soul. It is also a great place to find shade on a hot summer's day. For practical and emotional reasons, we need to preserve our planet's trees.

Topic 153.	A zoo has no useful purpose @Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.
Essay 1: Zoos are often controversial because many people believe they are unnecessary or even harmful if properly managed, I feel that zoos have a lot of value. In fact, I believe zoos are useful in two main ways: educating the general public and advancing scientific research. 
	Zoos can be wonderfully educational places. They provide a safe, controlled environment to learn about a specific species. Children can feel safe exploring the world of the chimpanzee there, and adults can learn about and see types of birds they've never seen before. Unlike in the wild, there's no worry of being physically harmed by an animal. 
	Zoos are also important for the research opportunities they provide. Research is safer and easier to conduct than in the wild. Scientists can feel secure in the confined area of the zoo. For example, while conducting a medical experiment in an open field, scientists have to worry about both the animal they are working with, and also other animals nearby. In zoos, however, they need only worry about the research subject. 
	In the wilderness, animals are also much harder to track and monitor. Zoos make research less time-consuming and expensive. Long term follow-ups are easier too, since even with monitors, wild animals often are killed or disappear. In zoos, researchers can observe an animal's entire life span. 
	Overall, I feel that properly managed zoos provide excellent opportunities for education and research, and are therefore very useful.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Children like to go to the zoo on holidays. They find it interesting to watch monkeys or bears doing funny things. But how many adults go to the zoo not for children's sake? I think few. Because we finally find that a zoo has no really useful purpose and it's not a truly fun place for us. 
	When a person breaks the law, he will be thrown into prison. But the animals in the zoo have done nothing to deserve being locked in a small cage. No plants, no water, just brick walls and floors. Every animal is in the same environment and can do no other things except for wandering around in the little space. Do you think that's what an animal should look like? And after visiting such a living place of animals as a zoo, no one would ever be left a nice impression of beauty and harmony of the nature that the zoo tries to demonstrate. 
	In addition, going to the zoo is not a good chance for educating children. Children see animals being tamed and locked, just for people to watch and have fun with. That will give the wrong impression to them that animals are ought to be like that. In such an artificial circumstance, they don't realize that animals and people are friends and they are just as important in the ecological system as we are. 
	The last but not the least, animals in the zoo are often treated badly by the visitors. People like to feed them with whatever they bring with them: hamburgers, popcorns, or even paper. Animals are not able to distinguish which food is bad for them and thus they eat too much unsuitable food. It is very harmful to their health. 
	So I don't see any useful purpose to build up a zoo in a city just for people's entertainment, but to sacrifice the animals' health and freedom. And it does no good to teach our children to have animals as our best friends.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Every city has one or more zoos. There is no denying the fact that whether a zoo is useful or not is a popular topic which has caused heated debate over a long period of time. Some people think that establishing a zoo of course has its advantages, while others think it makes no sense. And for a while, people think that a zoo is no useful purpose. As far as I am concerned, I disagree with this opinion. There are no less than three reasons to disagree with the opinion as rendered below. 
	One chief reason, which can be seen by every person, is that children can obtain direct knowledge about a variety of animals. They can see what tigers like, hear various sounds of birds and differ one animal from another. If there is no such a place, how can they make direct impression of animals? They may never have a chance to see various animals even though they learn many from book. 
	A further reason why I disagree the statement is that most of us live in cities and have many things to do. We must work for living and learn for obtaining a better job. Everyday we live with a rapid pace and we want to relax. A zoo of course is a good place for us to have a relaxation. There are so many lovely animals and so beautiful environment in which we can learn more things about animals as well as relax ourselves. 
	Finally, to be frank, there is also a more personal reason why I think a zoo is useful. When I was a little girl, I liked animals very much, especially birds. But I could not feed them for myself, so the zoo which was located near my home was the place I went to most frequent. And I really love these places. 
	Based on what has been discussed above, I may safely arrive at the conclusion that a zoo has its useful purpose.

Topic 154.	Smoking in public places @In some countries, people are no longer allowed to smoke in many public places and office buildings. Do you think this is a good rule or a bad rule? Use specific reasons and details to support your position.
Essay 1: Not allowing smoking in public places and office buildings is a very good rule. I believe this for several reasons. Not only will banning smoking improve people's health, it will also increase worker productivity and reduce conflicts. 
	We all know smoking is not healthy. Unfortunately, when smokers are able to smoke in public buildings, they can make other people sick. They may work with people who are allergic to smoking, for example. In that case, the non-smokers have no choice unless they want to quit their jobs. They can only get sicker, which is unfair. Of course, banning smoking in public buildings and offices will please non-smokers. It will also improve the smokers' health. They will have fewer opportunities to smoke, so they will smoke fewer cigarettes. 
	Banning smoking in office buildings can also increase worker productivity. Smokers won't interrupt their work all the time to smoke. There will also be fewer worker absences. When smokers cut down the number of cigarettes, they will get fewer smoking-related illnesses. 
	Finally, it is a good idea to ban smoking in public places and office buildings because a ban can reduce conflicts. Non-smokers tend to get annoyed and jealous because smokers have an excuse to take frequent breaks. The most significant conflict, however, is over whether smokers have a right to smoke in public. As we have already seen, non-smokers feel they are not always given a choice. If smoking in public is allowed, they will be forced to breathe harmful air. This may violate their rights, and non-smokers are angry with smokers because of it. 
	It seems clear that banning smoking in public places and office buildings is a good idea. It will reduce conflict and increase productivity. It will also benefit the health of smokers and non-smokers alike. I believe that just about anything that improves our health is a good idea!

Topic 155.	One important plant in your country @Plants can provide food, shelter, clothing, or medicine. What is one kind of plant that is important to you or the people in your country? Use specific reasons and details to explain your choice.
Essay 1: Plants can be considered the support of the life on Earth, due to their main feature: they are continuously providing oxygen because of photosynthesis process. Moreover, most plants are useful to people in many other different ways. 
	In my country, Romania (located in South-Eastern Europe), we consider wheat the most important plant. 
	During centuries, our ancestors had to fight numerous invaders in order to protect our most precious wealth: wheat. Until World War II, Romania had been considered the most important wheat producer of the entire continent. Unfortunately, after the war, my country was invaded by Soviet troops, having a sole purpose: stealing. They stole everything they found: money, jewellery, cars, industrial equipment and, last but not least, food. During that period, wheat flour was considered the most precious asset a person could own. 
	After the 60's, the situation returned to normal. Regrettably, however, wheat paddocks were considered a source for obtaining merchandise to be sold abroad, in return for foreign currency meant to fulfill Ceausescu's insane plans for "the new communist era". Dozens of trains full of wheat berries crossed our borders, while Romanian people were starving, fighting for a loaf of wheat bread. 
	After the collapse of communism, everybody believed that things would return to normal. 
	However, another problem occurred. Irresponsible people stole most irrigation equipment (pumps, pipes), so wheat production has been continuously decreasing. 
	At present, wheat is still considered a precious gift of nature given to our people. Thousands of people working in agriculture are treating this plant as the most important thing in their lives. 
	I hope that, sometime, all my nationals will give wheat the importance it deserves.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Chiquita, the name brand that most people see here in North America when they go get some bananas at the supermarket, is the mark for all the bananas produced at the Chiriquí Land Co. What not so many people know is that those bananas are from my country, Panama, where the plantation of this fruit means a very important income into our economy. 
	The production of bananas in Panama is one of the most important in the country. Since the beginning of the last century, native Indians from Panama have worked in the plantation of bananas. Thus, it means this has been a way to bring some income to all these homes and to the national economy, too. 
	The plantation of bananas means millions and millions of dollars to our economy every year. The bananas are not only for the local consumers, but also to be exported. The exportation of bananas not only to The United States but too many other countries is a source of money to our internal economy. Therefore, it means more school, hospitals and other benefits for the local population. 
	The quality of the banana plants and their product are excellent. Quality control is very demanding and meets the excellence of ISO 900. The banana plant is protected with a special plastic that covers the whole plant from all kind of insects and other animals. The bananas are washed and packed in boxes, where they keep the fresh and delicious smell and taste to be exported later on. 
	For the quality, excellence and delicious sweet flavour that only the bananas have, is what makes it the most important plant in my country and which means millions of dollars every year into our economy.

Essay 3: Hundreds of thousands of plans grow in my country because of its good climate and geographic position. And it is not surprising that my county is well known all over the Europe with its delicious and natural raised fruits and vegetables, such as peaches, apples, and potatoes. 
	Moreover, people of my country enjoy having many herbs and spices which help them in cooking. However, in my opinion, the most important plan in my country is the wheat. In is not only because the grain production is the most famous and developed agriculture branch but also because the wheat is the connected with our eating habits, our culture and our distinction as a nation. 
	First of all, the wheat is the staple for most of the people of my country. There are a lot of places on territory of my country with good climate and soil where wheat and other grain products can grow abundantly, so people choose wheat as their staple food. People eat bread and other bakery products on every meal they have. Indeed, almost each person gets for breakfast sandwich, pancakes or the famous baked rolls called "baniza". Moreover, nobody can imagine to have his lunch without slice of bread or small polled breads. And for dinner he got bread or other bakery products again on side to his home made meal. 
	Second, the wheat bread is the traditional meal of my county. In fact, wheat bread or wheat beans are always on celebrations and big events. There is no wedding without a big round bread for the bride and groom, christening without bread with fortune pieces inside, or funeral without cooked wheaten beans. Moreover, even in history books is written that when the R army liberated our country at the nineteen centuries, people meet soldiers with wheat bread and salt. Even now, on some big meetings when many relatives get together, there is bread in front of the door of the host, and everybody has to chop a piece of the read and eat it to show respect to the gathering and people of the family tree. 
	In conclusion, wheat is symbol of our nation. It is important for people of my country not only because it is their staple food but also because it is in their culture. Wheat is always and will always be a part of our nationality.

Essay 4: The coconut tree is a very important plant in my country. Coconut tree plantations are important sources of revenue, food and shelter. 
	Our country earns a lot of money from the export of coconut tree products like copra, coconuts, coconut oil, and coconut milk. This has been the main source of our foreign exchange for over a century. In fact, many of the coconut plantations were planted by various colonial powers and now, since independence, are run by our own citizens. 
	We not only export the food products of the coconut tree, we eat them ourselves too. The coco is the basis of much of our national cuisine-. We are famous for our curries made rich by coconut milk. We also use the oil to fry our foods as well as to add shine to our skin and hair. 
	The fronds of the coconut tree are also used to cover the walls and roofs of temporary shelters. 
	The breezes pass through the fronds and cool the interior, but the heavy rains, which fall daily, do not enter. 
	The coconut tree is a very versatile and useful plant. It is a tree that has served our country well.

Essay 5: Plants are vital to the survival of all life on Earth - plants transform the light of the sun into energy that is usable to other life on Earth. Without plants, animals would not be able to use the energy of the Sun that reaches the Earth. The removal of one plant from the ecosystem can cause many unforeseen changes, sometimes irreversibly damaging an ecosystem. However, some plants are more important than others, either for biological or cultural reasons. In my country, Korea, I would say that the grass that produces rice has come to be the most important plant, not just because rice is a staple food, but also for other cultural reasons. 
	Virtually every Korean eats rice at least twice a day. I, for example, had rice at breakfast, lunch, and dinner yesterday. For most Koreans, rice is an integral part of a meal, as expected in a meal as ink is to a pen or wheels are to a car - a meal without rice is not a meal. In fact, if I have dinner with my American friends and do not eat rice, I actually feel hungry even if I have filled myself with potatoes or other food while eating with them. Many of my friends have made similar comments to me. So, I believe that rice is as much a part of our daily lives as work or talking on the telephone is. 
	However, rice is much more than just a staple food to most Koreans - it represents the very sustenance of much of our culture. Our history teachers tell us that the development of rice as an agricultural product was largely responsible for the advancement of Korean culture - since rice was portable and had a long storage time, people had more freedom to move and were less susceptible to changes in the weather. In many ways, rice has come to be considered the perfect food, so ingrained is it in the minds of many Koreans, and many Asians for that matter, as food that we often say "have you had your rice" instead of saying “have you had your meal.” In fact, I have made this translation error many times while I have been in the United States. I have wanted to ask my American friends whether they have eaten, and I ask, "Have you eaten your rice?" Naturally, they often respond "no” leading to much miscommunication. For me, then, rice is more than just food - it is the very sustenance of most Koreans. 
	In short, rice is by far the most important plant in Korea. Were it removed from Korean society, Korea would change drastically, perhaps even have a famine much like the Irish Potato Famine of the 1800's. Rice is the very lifeblood of Korea.

Topic 156.	What foreign country to visit? @You have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks. Which country would you like to visit? Use specific reasons and details to explain your choice.
Essay 1: Many people cannot afford to visit a foreign country, because either they have no time or they have no money. Fortunately, I have the opportunity pay a visit a foreign country as I would like. The first choice comes into my mind is Italy. 
	As we know, there are so many classical architectures in Italy. I am an amateur architect. But I could only study those great works in the book or on the internet. Now that I have the opportunity to go there, I could observe them in a direct way. I think that will be totally a different experience. 
	Also a football fan as I am, I am eager to watch the best football match on the spot. I am looking forward to applause for the stars together with other fans. If possible, I will be lucky enough to get the signature of my favorite stars. 
	Tired after sightseeing and shouting at the stadium, I would like to lie on the beach of Mediterranean sea. It is the most beautiful sea shore in the world. Playing sand with children, drinking juice on the beach, and surfing on the waves are all my dream. 
	There are so many countries in the world, but Italy is my favorite. I could visit the great architectures, watch football matches, and enjoy the scene of Mediterranean Sea. Maybe two weeks’ time is too short for me.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: If I could visit any foreign country, I'd like to visit Ireland. The scenery there is so beautiful. Ireland has a lot of rain and that makes everything very green and lush. It hasn't become a completely industrialized country yet, so there are still areas where the countryside is unspoiled by pollution. Often, you can drive for miles without seeing another car or coming to a big city. I'd like to take my set of paints and several canvases and try to capture some of the scenes there. It seems every way you turn, you're looking at beautiful scenery. The area near the ocean is especially dramatic, with giant dark cliffs rising out of the water. 
	I also think I'd enjoy the slower pace of Ireland. It's so different from the busy pace of my country. Of course, Ireland's big cities are just as hectic as any big city anywhere. But many of the Irish live in smaller towns or on farms in rural areas. Visiting these places is very restful. People don't feel the need to stick to a schedule. Things get done, but in a much more relaxed fashion. In my country, there's the feeling that you're always late for something. In Ireland, it feels like you’re never late because no one stays on schedule. 
	Most of all, it would be interesting for me to meet the cousins in my mother's family. They live in Donegal. I could see the house where my grandmother grew up and where my cousins still live. This house is connected to a lighthouse. Visiting there would give me a clearer idea of what my grandmother's childhood was like. 
	Ireland would be a refreshing break from the life I lead in my own country. I wish I could go there.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: The answer of this statement depends on your own experience and life style. In my point of view, visiting China is as necessary as, if not more necessary than, visiting any other foreign country. So it is sagacious to visit China. There are numerous reason why I chose to visit China, and I would explore only a few of the most important ones here. 
	Certainly no other reason in my decision is more crucial than the one as bellow. China is the mother of more than a billion people, a fifth of the world’s population. You can meet people of as many as 56 different nations. In some parts of China, you can even live with a family for one day or more, from which you can get acquaintance with and learn more about Chinese, who are eager to make friends with people from all over the world. 
	Also, it is arbitrary to judge the best choice is visiting China according to the excuse I mentioned in the above paragraph. It is generally acknowledged that China is a nation with a pure culture from the east, and she has a history of more than 5000 years old. Over those years, people here have developed brilliant skills, and have built numerous great sites, the most famous ones of which are the Forbidden City and Summer Palace, both of which you can visit when you are in Beijing, the capital of China. 
	What is more, China has become more and more open to friend of other nations in the recent years. People here would like to get more information about other countries, and they are also eager to share their experiences with foreign friends. As a result, when you visit China, you can acquire some important information which may be crucial for you. 
	Taking into account all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that when you have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks, to visit China is the best choice.

Topic 157.	Studying at home or at school? @In the future, students may have the choice of studying at home by using technology such as computers or television or of studying at traditional schools. Which would you prefer? Use reasons and specific details to explain your choice.
Essay 1: If I had a choice between studying at home using computers and television and studying in a traditional school setting, I'd choose the traditional setting. Maybe it's just what I'm used to, but I don't think that technology can replace teachers and classrooms. 
	After all, technology can fail. Computers go down and computer programs crash. Televisions break, and the electricity can suddenly go off. In those situations, who's going to teach me? If I'm at school, and the television or the computers stop functioning, there's a teacher to step in and change the lesson plan. Teachers can draw on their teaching experience and be creative. Computers and televisions can't. 
	I'd also miss the chance to interact with other students if I weren't going to school. I think learning to play and work with other people is one of the most important lessons we learn in school. It prepares us for life, and for working with other people. Being with other people also helps us discover who we are. 
	Another concern I have about studying at home is getting distracted. It's strange, but I think being home alone is more distracting than being at school with a lot of people. At school, we're all focused on the same subjects. At home, it would be so easy to turn off the computer or the television and go do something else. I might tell myself that it's okay to play a computer game now and make up the study hours later. Chances are, I'd never make up the study hours. 
	I'm all in favor of using technology in the classroom. I think computers and television are great ways for students to have access to a lot of information. I just don't think they should be the only tools I have as a student. I also need teachers and other students to help me get a complete education.

Topic 158.	The opinions of famous people @When famous people such as actors, athletes and rock stars give their opinions, many people listen. Do you think we should pay attention to these opinions? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: Everyone is entitled to have an opinion. When it comes to opinions, though, there's a difference between the majority of people and celebrities like actors, athletes and rocks stars. If you're an average person, only your family and friends care about your opinion. If you’re famous, the whole world listens, or so it seems sometimes. Is this the way it should be? I don't think so. 
	We shouldn't pay attention to famous people's opinions just because of who they are. Being a famous basketball player doesn't make someone an expert on environmental issues. However, that basketball player has a better opportunity to be heard than most people do. If that player feels very strongly about an issue, he can use his fame to draw attention to it and get other people involved. Often, people with causes that aren't well-known ask celebrities to get involved. That way they can draw attention and needed dollars to that issue. 
	People who are rich put their money behind a cause. In the same way, famous people are using their most valuable asset. In their case, it's not money. It's their name recognition. Should people pay attention to what they think just because of who they are? I don't think so. I also don't think we should discount what they think just because of who they are. They have a right to their opinion. If their name draws people to that cause, all the better for the cause. 
	I think too often we categorize people and try to keep them in their place. Celebrities have brains and should be allowed to use them. When they're advocating a cause, their opinion should be just one of many factors we use to evaluate that cause.

@Notes: 
Essay 3: As far as I have known, I think we needn't pay attention to the words of the famous people. 
	Those famous people may have their own opinions, but let us get down to the fundament and agree that they are not people different from us. They made themselves notable people not because they have enough wits to win a game or do well in act. They just have their good health or good feature and this is why they succeed. I once met a famous actress. She has lots of fans in China, but when she talked about Lu Gou Bridge, she didn't know why it is well-known among Chinese people, even questioned why such a bridge should always be talked by Chinese people. Let alone her opinion about life. 
	Furthermore, if they do have their own feelings about life, the famous people's opinions are not useful to us. We have our own experience in our life, and we can learn them from our own experience. You may ask why cannot we learn from them then we can avoid the problems in our life. That maybe true, but we can learn these from books, and always books are good teachers of us, why should we bother to pay attention to those people's words. 
	Moreover, the famous people always give their opinions when asked by fans or reporters. In such a hurry they cannot even think enough about the question, and they split their words without knowing what they are speaking. In such a case, should we pay attention to their words? Almost the most devoted fan will not agree to say 'yes, sir, we should, whatever they may speak.' So, spare your time to do other thing more important than listen to those nonsenses. 
	SO I think we should not pay attention to these opinions.
@Notes: 
Topic 159.	One change about the 20th century @The twentieth century saw great change. In your opinion, what is one change that should be remembered about the twentieth century? Use specific reasons and details to explain your choice.
Essay 1: Which invention was the greatest invention of the 20th century has been discussed many times? Different people have different views. Some think the greatest invention was television, some think it should be cars. But as far as I am concerned, the greatest invention of the 20th century would be computers. The reasons for my opinion are as follows. 
	First of all, computers save a great deal of effort people spend on calculating. Before computers were invented, people had to calculate manually. Sometimes it took scientists weeks, even months to have a result. Of course, they might made mistakes during their calculation. That affected the accuracy of data. But with the help of computers, people are freed from heavy calculation. If only takes seconds to have a result which used to take weeks in the past.
	Second, computers can simulate different environments that can’t be created in real life. In the science research, sometimes scientist need to have a simulation environment to improve their theories or as a basis of further research. Without computers it’s difficult to have accurate and reliable results. But computers can make everything easy. Just input programs and data everything will be done. 
	The reason I think is becoming more and more important nowadays. That is computer is the way of access to the Internet. The Internet was developed based on the local area network (LAN) of computers. Today, the Internet has become the fastest developing medium in the world. You can find almost everything you need on the Internet, communicate with friends, read news, watch movies, listen to music etc. But you must do all the above things on a computer. Can’t log in the Internet means behind times today. 
	Although many other inventions of the 20th century brought great convenience to human or changed people’s lives, computers have the most valuable contribution to human, and it will have much more contribution in the future.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Many inventions have greatly changed the life of people. For example, when the electricity was invented, people can use light, so that they would not be afraid of night. When the car was born, people cannot have to go everywhere on foot. When the television entered into the history, people can better know the world. But, what is one change that should be remembered about in the 20th century, the popularity of computer is undoubtedly the answer. 
	We can look into every good aspect of the computer, but I want to explore the most important role the computer plays is that it greatly increases the efficiency of working. If you want to type a paper, you do not need to worry about the errors, the word process will examine for you automatically. Also you should not be worried about losing the paper, you can save it in the computer. In fact, that is just a piece of a cake for a computer, it cannot represent the function of a computer. When you enter into the international network, the computer will lead you into another world. In this way, you just stay at home, but you can know everything happening in the world in every corner. Isn’t it wonderful? Nowadays, many people choose to work at home to do work, as they can connect the offices by a computer. They say it greatly saves much time. 
	Second, the computer makes the communication much more convenient. In the past, we got the news by posting letters, in this way, it at least needed three days. However, if you send an electronic mail by a computer, you get the news only three seconds. Not only saving the time, but it can intense the emotion if you and your friends communicate more. 
	Third, computers also bring us much enjoyment. There are many games in the computer, for different kinds of people. So people find another way of relaxing them self except watching TV, seeing films. In fact, the computer games are not just only games, you can learn more from them, and they can also make you alert. 
	As the advantages I explore above, I think the computer should be remembered about in the 20th century.

Essay 3: There have been many changes, both technological and cultural, in the twentieth century. I believe that one stands out above the rest: advances in medical science. The changes in medical science go together with the changes in technological and cultural areas. One can move ahead only with the help of the others. We can see the results of medical advances in three areas: development of vaccines and antibiotics, expanded access to health care, and improved surgical techniques. 
	When medical researchers learned how to prevent disease and stop it from spreading, the quality of life for many people around the world improved. Today smallpox is a forgotten disease and vaccinations are no longer required. Polio is under control and the vaccine is widely available. The development of penicillin has helped many people recover from serious illnesses. 
	Although health care is not universal even in developed countries, it is much better than it used to be. Local clinics, visiting nurses, and specialty hospitals have all improved the health care for our communities. 
	If you should be unfortunate and require surgery, you are still lucky to have the surgery today rather than even ten years ago. Now with microscopic and laser surgery, operations are more efficient. You spend less time in the hospital and you recover faster. 
	I can't think of any other change that has affected the lives of so many people. Our health is important to all of us. We all are thankful for advances in the area of medical science.

Topic 160.	Way to complain about a product @When people need to complain about a product or poor service, some prefer to complain in writing and others prefer to complain in person. Which way do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: When I want to make a complaint about a defective product or poor service, I would rather make my complaint in writing. Writing a complaint allows me to organize my points of argument in a logical manner. If I'm really unhappy with the way I'm being treated, I want to present my reasons clearly. I don't want there to be any confusion about why I'm complaining. I like to list my complaints and then list supporting examples. That's the best way of making sure everyone is clear about what I'm saying. 
	Putting my complaint in writing also ensures it won't seem too emotional. If you feel that you've been treated badly or taken advantage of, it's easy to lash out. Losing your temper, though, is a sure way to lose your argument. Yelling is very satisfying at the moment, but it only makes the person you're yelling at mad at you. It doesn't get them to agree with you or to offer help. 
	There's also the issue of the person you're dealing with. If you complain in person, you have to talk to whomever is there. Chances are that he or she isn't the person responsible for the defective product or the poor service. Often the people who take complaints are not the people in charge, unless you're dealing with a very small business. Yelling at them isn't fair, and doesn't do anything to get a refund or satisfaction for you. You need to reach the person in charge. The best way to do that is in writing. 
	Writing about your complaint and sending the letter registered mail also gives you written proof. 
	It's clear that you tried to settle the matter in a reasonable manner within a certain time period. This way, if you need to take further action, you have physical evidence of your actions. 
	Writing a complaint has the advantages of organization, effectiveness, and fairness. That's why I prefer to write rather than personally present my complaints.

Topic 161.	Why do people remember special gifts? @People remember special gifts or presents that they have received. Why? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: I think we remember special gifts we've received because these gifts often are part of a special memory for us. It may be a memory of someone special we've cared deeply about. He or she may no longer be alive. Or it may be a memory of a special event in our lives. It may even be a memory of the person we once were at some particular moment in our lives. 
	Gifts from other people can make us feel joy every time we look at them. A gift from our parents, or our husband or wife makes us feel loved each time we see or use it. If we have children, the first gift our child made for us in kindergarten is cherished long after the child has grown up. A family heirloom given to us by a grandparent makes us feel connected to our past. A gift from a good friend is a reminder of all the good times we've shared. A memento from a respected colleague is a reminder of a job we worked on successfully together. 
	Gifts may also pinpoint special events in our lives. Gifts given to us as part of our religious heritage, such as First Communion or Chanukkah gifts, remind us of those celebrations. The same is true for gifts given for birthdays and graduations, and for the anniversaries of special days in our lives, like our wedding day. 
	Gifts can also be a symbol of the person we were at a particular point in our lives. A gift received in childhood may remind us of a passionate hobby that's now boxed in the attic. A gift received when we left a job may bring to mind the first career we had, now that we're on our third or fourth. 
	The gifts that are important to us are the ones that remind us of family, friends, and happy times. They're a way of surrounding ourselves with our past.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Do you still remember the new bike as a present for greeting your ten years old birthday from you parents? Do you still remember the first rose with the love of your lover? Everyone have been received a variety of presents and gifts, and everyone have many nice memory about them. People might conserve some special presents many years until they become old, for these presents not only represent the love, but also take them back to the past time.
	There are numerous reasons why I hold no confidence on them, and I would explore only a few primary ones here. The main reason of the argument I support is that there always are a good time or a touching day behind the cherished presents. Every time we open the present conserved for a long time, we seem to come back before, at that time we are so young and have a pleasure time with friends. For example, the favorite joy will recall you the best friend in your childhood.
	A beautiful skirt maybe represent the time of school. And there so many letters and cars which recall you the time of college. All of these memory are happy time, and all of these presents are indelible. Another reason can be seen by every persons is that gifts and presents contain the love and friendship of friends and relations. In different cultures and different countries people express their emotions to others by presenting gifts. And every special gift has a special meaning. For example, this skirt as a gift of ten years ago is you sister send to you in the party.
	A pearl necklace represents the love of your husband. We reserve these gifts and Love and friendship will always go with us. In addition, receiving a gift always bring you happiness and pleasure, and give you and your friends a good time.
	People like to send gifts each other for congratulations or in feast days. For example, perhaps everyone has some pieces of gifts for Christmas day. Some wife will reserve the important presents for wedding. General speaking, gift with the love and congratulations will bring you pleasure and happiness. Taking into account of all these factors, gifts and presents recall people the past good time and people will never forget them.

Topic 162.	The high salary of famous athletes @Some famous athletes and entertainers earn millions of dollars every year. Do you think these people deserve such high salaries? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.
Essay 1: Nowadays, there is a strange phenomenon that some famous athletes and entertainers earn millions of dollars every year. For me, I totally oppose to give them so much money as salary per year, which it will be unequal to other occupations. 
	Firstly, there are so many occupations around the world, such as artist, teacher, accountant, and worker. Viewed as one of occupations, entertainer or athletes are not much different from the rest of occupations. Both of them are just two kinds of occupations, why do we give them so much priorities or let them earn big amount so easily? For instance, an entailer will receive about hundred thousand per show, or a soccer player will be paid much more money than entailers. Although we admit that we can have a nice show to enjoy or a wonderful match to match, there is no need to give them such big amount. This is what they should do as an entailer or an athlete. This is their jobs. All occupations should have equal standard. 
	Secondly, no equalization is also not good to the young generation. If most young people know that they can earn more money as an athlete or an entailer, definitely they will go after. As a result, they do not want to do anything other than to be an athlete or an entailer. What's more, this phenomena has an important impact on young people about their views towards money. They will think as an entailer he is so easy to get money as much as possible, which is not good for his development in future. They will become money-goers. 
	Last but not least, athletes and entertainers sometimes show bad examples to their fans. It is known that fans follow whatever their idols do, even some bad habits. Recently there is a piece of news reported that one famous singer found to be carrying prohibited drugs in a KTV. Can you imagine what kind of side effect we will face after this issue? Previously, idols are always perfect in most fans' minds, but now they did such things, sometimes even more worse. As a public person, they need to be careful about what they do. 
	In conclusion, I think some athletes and entertainers do not deserve high salaries because athletes and entertainers are the same as the other jobs and they do whatever they should do, in addition, they sometimes show bad examples in front of the public.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Some athletes and entertainers earn millions of dollars annually. In contrast, an elementary school teacher, on average, probably makes less than $35,000 a year. I think the fact that this difference is commonplace is a sign of our society's misplaced values. It shows that we put more importance on entertaining our children than on educating them. It seems that the careers that are the least valued in our society often are those that are the most important. 
	Why is this so? The market determines who gets paid what. Teachers are paid by tax dollars. Sports teams make hundreds of millions of dollars every year. These teams earn fabulous profits from radio and television rights, as well as everything sold at the concessions stands. The same is true of movies. They are produced by studios that make huge profits annually. These enterprises can afford to pay their entertainers and sports figures huge salaries, because those athletes and film stars draw people to the entertainment. 
	Why are we willing to pay so much to see a ball game or a movie, but not for a good teacher? Maybe it's because we want distraction; we want to be entertained. Maybe it's because we think of education as a right, while entertainment seems like a luxury. We expect to pay for our luxuries. 
	It's not that I begrudge the players and entertainers their huge salaries. Most of them have very short careers. Athletes may be too old in their early 30s: Many of them gamble early in their lives on making it big in the sports or entertainment world, and deny themselves a good education. They have little chance of a stable career, so they need to earn enough, money to support them for a long time. On the other hand, most of us aren't going to earn $10 million in a lifetime of work. So it's hard to sympathize with people who do. 
	We have to ask ourselves: who really gives the most value to society?
@Notes: 
Topic 163.	The ability to read and write @Is the ability to read and write more important today than in the past? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Essay 1: While some countries have strong programs against illiteracy, others still do not care that much. But, illiteracy has become a big obstacle during the last century and is still problematic question now with quick development of technology and automation. From my everyday experience and observation I can state several factors which defend the statement that reading and writing now is more important than ever before. 
	First of all, it is essential for a person to have at least basic knowledge of reading and writing to survive in our society. While in the past, some people could live in wilderness or even in cities without any knowledge of written language, now it is almost impossible. The way of living has change so much that it is impossible to be a part of nation, especially in developed countries, without ability to read and write your bills, to understand your mortgage documents or job applications. Moreover, you can go nowhere by yourself but in your own small town without reading the maps and signs on the roads and in cities. 
	Second, nowadays, most of jobs require reading and writing as necessary skills and tendency that these skills will be more and more important for future jobs increases. In fact, because of sharp development of technology, more of jobs on the labor market are for literate people and less of them are for people without any or slight reading or writing knowledge. For example, there are not needed so much people who can work on lands or select parts in auto-factories because the machines do that kinds of jobs now. On the other hand, factories and corporations need people who can read the instructions and control the machines. It is bare true that without jobs that need only physical abilities, illiterate people are forced to be constantly on unemployment lists. 
	In conclusion, the most scare part of living illiterate in our society is maybe living dependable of someone. An illiterate person will have difficulties not only to do simple tasks such as writing bills, withdrawing money from cash machines, or reading menu in a restaurant, but also to be a productive and useful individual of our society with job and normal life.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: It is a very dangerous thing to say that basic literacy skills are more important now than they have ever been in the past. While a strong argument can be made in favor of this idea, making such an argument would imply that reading and writing were somehow less important in the past. While there is a grain of truth to the argument that literacy was not fundamental to the daily existence of most people in the pre-Industrial Revolution period, rationalizing such a lack of need for education in such a way is the first step to withholding education from certain groups, a great social crime that has led to the disempowerment of disadvantage groups all over the world throughout history. However, if we can keep in mind that education is a basic human right, then we can discuss the strengths of the proposition that literacy is more important now than it has ever been before. 
	It is true that in the past the majority of people all over the world made their livelihood from agricultural activities and that the vast majority of these activities required little or no literacy skills. In some senses, we could argue that literacy skills were less important in the agricultural age than they are now, but to do so would be to forget that literacy also reflects an active mind and that people have always needed to engage in activities of the mind. For example, even though a farmer might have laboured all day in her corn field, she may enjoy reading the latest Jane Austen novel when arrived at home. We can see in this example that while literacy was not directly related to this labourer’s livelihood, literacy was important to her quality of life. 
	However, we could make a good argument that literacy is more important now that it was in the past. As we all know, the world is experiencing a revolution that may turn out to be more important than the Industrial Revolution. We are now entering the Information Age, an age in which information and knowledge have more value than the ability to build machines, create "stuff," grow crops, or even mine precious metals and produce gemstones. Nowadays, accurate information may be worth more than the most expensive Rolls-Royce or the biggest diamond. The perfect example of this increasing dominance is the explosive rise in the popularity of the Internet - the Internet offers the world countless bytes of information twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year. Companies all over the world, but principally in the United States, are rushing to stake their claim in cyberspace and stiff competition among companies has resulted. In order to gain dominance, these companies must have the best-skilled workers, an advanced understanding of computer systems, and good intuition about what will happen in the future. All of these abilities to compete in the global marketplace stem directly from literacy skills and those without these skills will be stuck in the service, agricultural, and heavy industry fields. 
	In short, we can see that people in the past who were lacking in literacy skills essentially had more company than those lacking these skills have today and could still earn their livelihood. Further, we could argue that because of the nature of the global marketplace and because of the emergence of the Information Age, we could make the argument that literacy is fundamental to professional success nowadays. However, literacy should be considered a basic human right in a literate society - all people throughout history should have learned to read and write.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: For ages, reading and writing has been vital aids to the intellectual, emotional and spiritual growth of mankind. But with rapid changes in the society and scientific advancement of human race over the decades, the necessity and importance of reading and writing has increased remarkably.
	Several reasons account for the lesser importance of reading and writing in the past. Firstly, education was restricted to certain sections of the society and not everyone benefited from its advantages. Only the learned few enjoyed intellectual satisfaction. Knowledge was not shared freely due to lack of proper means of communication, thus preventing many from realizing the benefits of education and learning. Secondly, technology was not so advanced in the past. Hence the general pace of life was slower than it is now and people did not feel the need to keep themselves abreast of affairs around them. In other words, the need did not arise for mass awareness and participation in efforts for intellectual enlightenment through reading and writing. Nevertheless, writing was a more popular than reading since it was the most common means of communication - in the form of letters. 
	However, at present the scenario has changed considerably. Innovation and change are integral parts of life. Now advancement in technology marks the day. To cope up with the rapidly evolving new ideas and concepts, reading has become more important now than ever before. Invention of high-tech gadgets and state-of-the-art information systems in areas of communication, transport and general business demands more awareness about contemporary events and changes.
	With advancement in technology, man's eagerness to succeed has increased. Consequently the realization has dawned on him that such dreams can be materialized through intellectual advancement - a feat possible only through self-reading and personal research. With the invention of computer has commenced an age of electronic communication and online commerce. Although writing letters has decreased considerably with the advent of electronic mail, it will take some time to make our varied businesses paperless. Thus though reduced, people still do some writing, wither in forms of documents, memorandums, business contracts or research papers. Education has made people more aware of his potential and reading and writing has become instrumental to man's success in today's competitive world.
@Notes: 
Essay 4: I think that reading and writing is more important now than in the past. Many factors influenced to make the written expression more useful and necessary at present than in the past. 
	The world is changing. Information became essential, and the world is getting into a sort of communication age. A great part of this communication is written. The summary of the information, about the human knowledge, is written either in books or computer s files. 
	Since ancient times, men and women devoted their lives to survive and fight against nature's limitations and dangers. 
	They had to discover a solution for each new problem, and this is the way the civilizations began. They developed the languages to transmit knowledge, and as a need. Consequently, they needed a way to communicate and file this pool of knowledge. 
	At first, to read and write was only a possibility to some whose activity required it, and it was restricted to privileged people who could afford it, or get it (because of the long distances, and the availability of teachers) 
	Now all has changed. Women were seen only as wives whose only work was at home, and as mothers whose life should be centered on the children's care. 
	Today, not only read and write is essential, but also some computer skills (at least basic), among others, are seen as basic education. 
	There are thousands of examples, just to name some if you can't read, you could not get informed, and you can’t even search for work. You could walk at the front of the windows of potential employers (who are usually asking for "help"), without notice; newspaper s adds offering jobs wouldn't be any more than paper for you. You could get irradiated inadvertently (even the information about the caution signaling, is written!). 
	You wouldn't even be able to visit a city without getting lost, otherwise you’d have to ask people how to get everywhere. A funny proverb goes as follows "word contracts doesn't even worth the paper in which they're written", but you would never know what you are about to sign, except for what they say it says. And so on. All these situations were not so common in the past, villages were small, people trusted in other people's word, nobody travelled so much, and all knew their own town good enough. Dangerous situations were easy to recognize, unlike radioactivity, for example. 
	To conclude, for all the above reasons, I am convinced that read and write, is very much important now than in the past. Otherwise I would not be here, it became so important that I have to learn how to read and write not only in my language but in a second language too. That's life (today)!

Essay 6: Today more than at any time in the history of the world it is important to be able to read and write. This change has been brought about by the Internet which we use to communicate with one another, to get our news, and to sell our products. 
	Millions of people communicate today through e-mail using the Internet. In the past people would have face-to-face meetings or call one another on the phone; today they use e-mail and chat rooms. It is obviously necessary to be able to read and write in order to participate in this technological revolution. 
	Today, one can subscribe to news and information services on the Net. When you turn on your computer in the morning, you are given the headlines, financial news, sports scores, or social events that you requested. The news is tailored to your specifications. In the not distant past, most people got their news from television or radio-as many still do. Yet, getting your news from the Internet is more efficient since the news is tailored to your specific interests. 
	E-commerce also demands that people be able to write and read. Of course, the people who design the retail web sites, must be able to express themselves clearly in writing. The potential customers must he-able to read the product descriptions. In the past, people would go into stores (as many still do) and point to objects that they would like to buy. This physical approach to shopping does not require any special language skills. 
	The Internet will force us all to be literate not only in reading and writing, but also with computers. Today, we must be skilled readers and writers to be successful in the high tech world.

Essay 1: Our health is the only thing we really have in the world. You can take away our money, our house, or our clothes and we can survive. Take away our health and we will die. That is why I eat healthfully, exercise regularly, and keep up my social life. 
	Eating healthfully is important to maintain one's health. I try to avoid foods high in fat like French fries or cookies. I also try to limit the amount of animal protein I consume. I never eat more than a few ounces of fish or chicken a day and I rarely eat meat. I eat a lot of vegetables and fresh fruit which are full of fiber and vitamins. It is important to know how to cook these foods so the nutrients are not lost in the cooking process. 
	Your muscles must continue to be strong to support your body as it grows older. Exercise helps the bones build density and helps you maintain your posture. A regular exercise program of cardiovascular training and weight training is an important part of keeping you healthy. 
	Friends are an important part of one's health. Studies have shown that people with a wide range of social contacts get fewer colds and have fewer complaints than those who don't. Laughing is also an important part of health. Hike to laugh with my friends and I always feel better when I am with them than when I am alone.

I chose to spend my time working with elementary school children helping them to learn to read. Developing good reading skills will help these students keep up with their classmates, open new worlds to them, and help them succeed in life. 
	Students who are not good readers cannot keep up with their studies. They will not understand the lessons; they will come to school unprepared; they will not be able to perform. By learning to read, students will be on equal footing with their classmates. They will be active participants in class. 
	Books on different lifestyles, occupations, cultures, or governments will open new doors to students. Students who can't read will only know what they see around them. Students who can read will be able to travel to new worlds and experience new ideas without ever leaving their classrooms. 
	Today, a person who can't read is severely handicapped. A non-reader will have to work at the most menial jobs. Readers, especially good readers, have the whole universe open to them. They will have the possibility to learn any job that interests them.

	We may look into every possible events, however, the foremost should be the entrance to college. From the first day on campus, we have to do a lot of things all by ourselves, washing clothes, cleaning domes and buying fruits. A child never worry about these things. We also learn how to protect ourselves and how to get well with the others. We keep alert to judge whether our behaviors are right or wrong and distinguish which is good or bad for us. When we meet difficulties, we can overcome them by our own efforts instead of asking for help from you parents, we become adults since the moment. 
	When we graduate, we find a job and live on our own earnings. We work hard and do a good job to make our value by give our own contributions to the society. We plan how to use our time and money to make ends meet. We help who are in the hardship. When we get rewards, we become adults since the moment. 
	Then we get married and have children. We teach them how to walk, how to speak and how to become adults. We also make our parents and relatives happy. We become adults since the moment. 
	So life is beautiful. To become an adult means to become more independent and more responsible.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: The difference between children and adults are very easy to tell from their physical outlooks: children and small, weak, have a poor judgment, and have to depend on adults. On the contrary, adults are big, strong, and more independent. Every child will grow up to become an adult. What events make a person an adult? In my personal opinion, there are a lot of events which mark the turning point for a person to become adult. 
	In many countries, when a child becomes eighteen years old, he or she legally becomes an adult. There will be a big celebration and many best wishes from relatives and friends; the young person may also have a great longing for a bright future in his adult life. He may move out from his parents’ house and live alone; he may start dating and doing activities which only adults can do, such as going to a pub. 
	Graduation from college is another big turning point for a person to become adult. In college the young person may reply fully or partially on his parents for financial support, but after he graduates, he must find a job for himself, and live on his own. Graduating from college and joining the work force can also make a person an adult. 
	Marriage is also a big event to a person. Once become husband or wife, the young person starts to take care of others, and take responsibility for the family. Once the young person becomes a parent, he or she should also take care of the baby. 
	I believe that getting married and have children is the most important event that turns a person into an adult. Only after one gets married, does he or she take on the responsibility to the family and the society.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: There are so many differences between children and adults, such as adults always make decisions independently, while children often deal with things under the supervision of adults. Although it is a course that a child grows up and become an adult, I believe that many events play a significant role in it. Based on the experience and life style of my own, leaving parents and living alone is the event that turn a child into an adult. 
	The main reason of the argument I support is that living independently could develop the ability of thinking and doing independently. In family, parents always prepare everything and create a comfortable condition for children. Children at home are almost carefree, and need not worry about cooking, washing, making cleaning, and the only thing they have to care of is study. However, when living in the dormitory of school, they have to begin to study how to deal with house work and how to get on alone with others. And it is more important that they have to think independently and make decisions like adults. 
	Another reason can be seen by everyone is that to live independently a child will have to face many problems which need courage and the capability to cope with. Without the help from parents, children will find there are so many unexpected concrete troubles cannot be resolved only by themselves. For example, when a freshmen move into dormitory, he or she have learn to change the light bulb, clean the house, how to get on well with roommate and so on. At this time, making friends and helping each other are very important for them to resolve the troubles. 
	In addition, the frustration and even the failure in life is very significant in the course of growth. An experience, example, or observation impart beneficial new knowledge and wisdom. In the same way, a failure bring children lessons and make their thought and behavior mature and sense. 
	General speaking, living independently will develop the ability of dealing with things of children, test the courage of cope with difficulties of them, and bring them many lessons. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that living by own make a child mature and wise, and turn a child into an adult.

Topic 167.	Should buy computers or books @Your school has enough money to purchase either computers for students or books for the library. Which should your school choose to buy - computers or books? Use specific reasons and examples to support your recommendation.
Essay 1: Our school has been given a grant to make necessary improvements to its facilities. We can spend it on new books for the library or on more computers. Our school already has books in its library and it already has computers. Since we have more books than computers, I think that new computers will benefit the students more. 
	Computers can access up-to-date information on the Internet. Right now, the reference books in our library are very outdated. Our encyclopedia set is eight years old. But if every student had access to a computer, we all could have the latest facts and figures on everything. 
	Unfortunately, giving every student a computer means we need a lot of computers. Right now, the ratio of computers to students is one to twelve. This means students only get to work on the computers three or four times a week. But if every student had a computer, we could use it whenever we wanted. 
	"Information on demand" should be our slogan. Students today need lots of information right away. Life goes by too quickly to wait. It takes forever to identify a book that you think might have the information you need. Then you have to go to the library and look for the book. Usually it's not even there. 
	With a computer, information searches are instantaneous. If we all had computers, we could access more information and access it faster by computer. We could have all the information we needed for our schoolwork. We could all improve our grades. For these reasons, I feel that purchasing more computers will benefit us more than buying more books.

Topic 168.	Studying outside our country @Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.
Essay 1: Nowadays, more and more students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Then why studying abroad is so attractive even though it often means greater expense and more difficulties? We may say that those students are bound to benefit considerably from their foreign study experience. 
	The modern world needs people to have comprehensive knowledge and experiences. The world is no longer a separated one in which each part can afford to be totally independent. The communication and interchange in fields of culture, business, finance and other human activities are so unprecedentedly frequent and vigorous that the general or specific knowledge of other members of the global village turns to be most important to the prosperity of the country, or the success of a people. This kind of knowledge is usually bettered achieved if pursued abroad. 
	Furthermore, foreign experiences improve one's willpower and ability of adjusting to a new environment, and one's capability to overcome various hardships and setbacks. Young people are considered aggressive and ambitious. Their success is not based on comfort or easiness, but on their incessant painstaking effort and their never-ending willingness to surpass themselves. In a foreign country they are confronted with greater challenges, more unsteadiness and less help from their families and friends. All these undoubtedly lead to an independent, self-supporting, resourceful person who will also be sympathetic and generous to other people around. 
	With these advantages, we may conclude that the foreign study experience enlarges a student's view of the world, as well as improves one's personality and character, which will guarantee a more splendid future in his life and career.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Now, many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. I think that there are a lot of reasons to explain this phenomenon and I would in here illustrate a few of the most important ones. 
	Firstly, I believe that these students would prefer to study in a foreign country in order to learn more advanced skills and technology. In general, these students intend to learn in a developed country such as the Unites States. Needless to say, the US is the most developed country. It has many famous universities such as the Harvard. It is these famous universities that foster a number of eminent talents. It is these talents who let the US become the foremost country in the world. All of these are an appeal to attract many foreign students. After they graduate, they can apply the knowledge they learn to the construction of their own country. Maybe their homeland can become very developed someday. 
	Secondly, studying in a foreign country is helpful to learn a foreign language. In a foreign, you have to communicate with the others in the local language. In order to exist, you must force yourself to accept the challenge of language. I think that this is the best way to learn a foreign language. 
	Thirdly, understanding the foreign culture and appreciating the foreign landscape should be a reason. Although we can understand some circumstances of a foreign country through TV or internet, this way is absolutely not better than viewing in person. 
	After understanding the reasoning above, I believe that studying outside our countries should a very good thing.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: Nowadays, there are more and more students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. As far as I am concerned, there are several reasons for the students to do so. First, students study abroad due to the reason that they can learn more new knowledge and the new way of thinking. Secondly, they can make more new friends, and thirdly, they can grow more independently. 
	Students study abroad can learn more new knowledge and the new way of thinking. Having been studied for many years in the homeland, it is necessary for students to go abroad and accept the knowledge there. It is not because the new and plentiful knowledge but the different ways of thinking. These new things together with what were learned in the homeland would make a student develop in full scale and know more about the world. 
	In addition, when students are studying abroad, they will contact with students come from all over the world and surely they will become friends. Students will not only have more friends but also gain knowledge from them during the communication and the association. They will talk about the history of their own country and the customs of their people and they will also help each other in study and daily life, all of which could benefit the students. 
	The last but not least, students in abroad may do things all by themselves. Therefore, they could get rid of the protection from their parents and learn how to face the difficulties, which help them grow independently and better. 
	Studying abroad, students could harvest a lot which due to the stating reasons above. In conclusion, there are many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their countries. If I have chance, I will definitely choose to study abroad.

Essay 4: Attending a university in one's home country or in another country is a question. Some people hold the opinion that attending a university in home country is superior to attending a university in another country. Others, however, contradict finishing their university education abroad. Personally, I would prefer attending a university in another country because I think it has more advantages. 
	There are numerous reasons why finishing university education abroad is preferable, and I would in here explain a few of the most important ones. The main reason is that communication is more and more important today. It takes place in almost every field of our lives, including the field of education certainly. So attending a university in another country can get direct and quick communication with the world. It can be given a concrete example. I am a law school student and my country's law education is influenced by that of Germany. So most of what I learned was translated from the books in Germany. Translation, you know, can't help twisting the writers' true meanings sometimes and always needs much time. So the result was that I got inaccurate information sometimes and always cannot catch up with the latest views. What if I finish my university education in Germany? I thought later. 
	Another reason why I advocate the attitude of attending a university in another country is that it is contributed to complete my personality. Take the case of a thing that studying abroad means I can't rely on my family while only depend on myself when I meet troubles. This makes me independent. 
	Finally, attending a university in another country can bring me a lot of pleasure. The study and life overseas must be different from that in my home country. So finishing university education abroad not only gives me an entirely new study, but also gives me an entirely new life, which must be interesting. In addition, attending a university in another country also gives me a chance to make interesting foreign friends. 
	Of course, choosing attending a university in the home country also have advantages to some extent, for example, if you don't have much money, finishing university education in your hometown means a lighter burden for you. 
	But if all these factors are contemplated, the advantages of attending a university in another country in the home country. From what has been discussed above, we may finally draw the conclusion that if you finish your university education abroad, you get a complete study and a rich and colorful life.
@Notes: 
Essay 5: Although students can get a good education in most subjects at their home universities, it is important to study abroad for some or part of one's college education. Study abroad can give a student competency in a new language, familiarity with a different culture, and a chance to grow in different ways. 
	One cannot deny that it is important to be bilingual or even multilingual in today's fast-paced world. We have a global economy and communication by Internet and satellite TV means we must be familiar with other languages in order to keep up with new developments. 
	Knowing another culture is also important today. Respect for other peoples and their traditions will foster cooperation and peace. We should all do our part to make sure the world is safe for our children. It will only be safe if we understand and respect other people and their culture. 
	When we are out of our environment, we feel more free to experiment with different ways of doing things. We are all individuals and we need time to be on our own, away from our comfortable nests. We may try different things and reject them. We might also adopt them. People can change and it is easier to change when you are away from your family surroundings. 
	Study abroad can be enriching. Not only can we learn a new language, understand more about a different culture, but we can learn more about ourselves too. At the same time, of course, we are getting an education in the formal sense.

Topic 169.	Why is music important to many people? @People listen to music for different reasons and at different times. Why is music important to many people? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.
Essay 1: Music seems to be a natural need for people. I've read that from ancient times human beings have produced sounds from "instruments" like rocks or skins stretched over a wooden frame. Music is something most people want and need. I think it's important because it can be a major part of both community and individual experience. 
	Music is a way of sharing a common bond or feeling. When we're children, we learn very simple songs called nursery rhymes. These songs help make us part of our culture by telling us what's acceptable and what's not. We play and sing music in our religious ceremonies because it enhances the worship experience. We play music when we're going to war or celebrating the fact that we've won a war. 
	We have national anthems to share our love and pride for our particular country. We have music we play for our school, and music we play for our athletic team. In fact, music has become a big part of athletic games. We use it to taunt the other team as well as celebrate when points are scored for our team. 
	Music is also a major part of individual experiences. When we fall in love, music is usually a part of that experience. People talk about having "our song." That means the song that was playing when they met or a song they both liked when they fell in love. When we get married, we play music before and after and sometimes during the ceremony. It expresses how we feel. We play music to calm our nerves or to stimulate ourselves to get on with a task. We also play music for the simple enjoyment of listening to the sounds. 
	Music is special to us because it expresses our connection with our culture, and because it enhances our individual experiences. Nothing else seems to capture our feelings quite so well.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: Music plays a very important role in our life. We can almost hear music anywhere. Different music serves different functions in our life. Why is music important to many people? The reasons are presented below. 
	Music is a very important form of art. Like other arts, music is ubiquitous and has become a part of our life. The whole lifetime of most people is accompanied by music. A baby falls in sleep in the music of a lullaby; a young student may learn to play a musical instrument and listen to music from the radio, TV and a Walkman. There is music for birthdays, for weddings, for Christmas, for New Year's Day. There is music for every single occasion in our life. 
	We are surrounded by various kinds of music since we were born and music has become an integral part of our life. Interesting enough, music often serves as an important part to other art forms, such as music in dancing, drama and movies. As a matter of fact, many famous music pieces come from dancing and movies, such as the theme from "Love Story." 
	Music is part of the history. The history of music is almost as long as the history of human civilizations. Music from old times has become the great culture heritage to us. One of the examples is classic music of Beethoven and Tchaikovsky. People enjoy their music from generation to generation. 
	Listening to music is one of the most popular forms of entertainment. There are so many kinds of music that can suit tastes of different people. Young people like pop music and Rock-and-Roll and older people may enjoy classical music and opera. Whether we are happy or sad, there will always be music that we can listen to. 
	People can express their feelings and emotions through music. Lovers often play soft love songs to show their love and devotion to each other. 
	For the reasons presented above, we can see how important music is to our life. It is hard to imagine a history without music, and a life without music.

Topic 170.	Why are organizations important to people? @Groups or organizations are an important part of some people's lives. Why are groups or organizations important to people? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.
Essay 1: Groups or organizations are an important part of our life because we are social people. We like to get together with people whose attitudes and beliefs are like ours. The most important groups for us are our families, our religious organizations, and our political organizations. 
	Our families are obviously our most important group. You will never find the physical and emotional support from any other group that you will find in your family. Your family is part of you; you are tied to them by blood. They will always be there for you. 
	Similarly, our religious organizations can provide comfort for us in times of stress. When we are with people who have the same beliefs, we feel better. Our beliefs are based on tradition. These beliefs have been tested over time. These beliefs tell us how to respond and how to act. 
	Our political organizations change as we change. Some years we may feel conservative; other years we may feel more liberal. Whatever our political philosophy, we can find apolitical organization that matches our thinking at the moment. These political organizations help us be a part of the larger community. 
	Whether the group is tightly knit like a family, spiritual like religion, or secular like politics, they all serve a function in our life. They all help us feel as if we belong.

Topic 171.	Taking items in your one-year trip @Imagine that you are preparing for a trip. You plan to be away from your home for a year. In addition to clothing and personal care items, you can take one additional thing. What would you take and why? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.
Essay 1: If I were to leave my home for a year, there is one thing I definitely would take with me: my cell phone. With my cell phone, I could call my friends or family if lever was lonely, needed advice, or just wanted to talk. 
	If I were away from home for a year, I would be very lonely, especially in the beginning before I made friends. If I could call my mother and father, I would hear their familiar voices and I would not feel so lonely. Hearing my friends' voices would also help me overcome my sadness. 
	I've never been on my own so there are many things I am not familiar with. I've never opened a bank account, got a driver's license, or made my own food. If I had to cook chicken or something, I could call up my mother and she could tell me how to make dinner. 
	Sometimes, I may just want to talk in my own language. With my cell phone, I could call my friends and tell them about my new life. This would make them jealous of me. I would call them a lot so they could hear all the wonderful things I am doing. 
	For me a cell phone is a necessity. I would need it anytime I was lonely, anytime I needed to do something I didn't know how to do, and anytime I just wanted to talk. Of course, the phone bill will be sent to my parents.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: If I were going to travel for a long time, what should I take besides the clothing and personal care items? The first thing came into my mind is a camera. Not only because I am a photographing amateur, It really worth a lot. It will record my trip exactly and vivaciously. I could share the photos with those who cannot travel for so long a time like me. And it may help me in emergencies. 
	By taking the photos, I could record my trip easily. I don't need to spend a lot of time on writing down what I see, so that I could rest more. The interesting costume of the people, the exotic architectures, the great scene, and so on, everything will be "written down" by the camera. Obviously, the photos are my whole life's treasure, because maybe I will never be there again. 
	Not everyone could have the opportunity like me to travel such a long time. They may be busy all the time, or may not have healthy body to travel. Fortunately, my friends could enjoy the photos I take during my trip. They could see what interest me without stepping out their house. 
	Furthermore, the camera may help me if I were in short of money. I would exchange my camera to get money in case of emergency. The most valuable to me is the films I take not the camera itself. 
	So, in addition to the personal necessities, I strongly recommend you to take a camera. You could record what you see at anytime. The photos you take will certainly be a fortune to share with friends. And you can exchange money in your emergencies.
@Notes: 
Essay 3: When you see a beautiful view of rising sun, when you see a spectacular waterfall, when you enjoy the moment you travel with your friends, at this time, what do you especially want? I believe the answer is a camera. It is also what I would take in addition to clothing and personal care items when I plan to have a long trip. Among countless factors, there are two conspicuous aspects as follows: 
	The main reason for taking a camera is a camera will record everything that happens in a trip. If you encounter beautiful scenery, you can take a picture of it. If you meet a humorous and nice person in a trip, you can have someone taken a picture for you and the new friend. If you meet a girl you love in the trip, why not ask your friend to take a picture when you send a rose to her? Let’s imagine how disappointed it is if you do not have a camera with you at that time. 
	Another reason can be seen by every person that each picture is a memory. Maybe a person will take many trips in his life, if you take many pictures in each trip, you will find it is just like a novel about your own life. When you are old, you will always recall many things that happened long before. At that time, I swear that you will take out the albums and "read" them with happy tears. You also can find how you loved the life and what a pleasant life that god gave you. 
	Above the two reasons, you can find it is very important to take a camera with your trip. And that is my choice when I am preparing for a trip.

Topic 172.	Helping new students deal with proplems @When students move to a new school, they sometimes face problems. How can schools help these students with their problems? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.
Essay 1: Students moving into a new community and attending a new school can face a lot of problems. Their biggest worry is usually fitting in. The school counselor, the school's administration and the students' teachers can all help the students come through this experience successfully. They can engage other students to become involved with the new students, too. 
	New students in a school need to feel like pan of the school community as quickly as possible. A school administrator should begin by giving students a complete orientation to their new school. They should take them on a tour of the school and show them the classrooms, gym, computer lab, band room, and cafeteria. They should tell them about the history of the school, its academic achievements, and its athletic and debating teams. The administrator can talk to the students about what's expected of them in the classroom and what rules the school has. 
	The school counsellor should talk to the students about what they're most interested in studying. If these are older students, the counselor can ask them about career interests. If these are younger students, the counselor can ask them about their favourite subjects at their old school. The counsellor can tell the students about all the extracurricular activities there are at the school. For example, the school might offer things like sports, art, music, and working on a school newspaper. 
	The teachers have the most important job when it comes to new students. It's up to them to help the students meet other students in class. They can also help them learn how classes are conducted in their new school. They can encourage other students to make friends with new people and help them learn the system. Since they're with the students the most, they can keep an eye on them and make sure they're adapting well. 
	Both the adults and the other students need to help new students feel a part of their new school. It's not easy, but it pays off with happier, more successful students in the end.
@Notes: 
Essay 2: It is undoubtedly important for a freshman to get accustomed to the new environment as soon as possible, of course, the ability of adaptation varies from one person to the other, with the more tough situation for those who have never left his or her home and lived alone, but what role should the school play considering how to help the newcomers to adapt themselves to the new surroundings and the new atmosphere? 
	I think ,the school ,should at first offer the orientation service to the newcomer to aid them in becoming familiar with the kinds of buildings ,such as the lab buildings ,the teaching building ,the dormitory apartment and so on ,which will be at convenience for the newcomers' later study and life .Then ,the school had better develop the relevant service network and hand out the brochure and other materials of the introduction of the school as well as the service booklets ,in which all the service phone numbers should be included with the purpose of offering the service when and where. Besides, the school should organize the volunteers to be at hand for the new students to consult and they also can give a brief introduction of the school. 
	What is more ,the school should develop the atmosphere for the prospective students to feel at home and like to study and live at the school even at the first sight .As we all known ,if impressed by the scenery or some person or somewhere at the first sight ,we will naturally have a crave to experience the scenery again ,to keep in touch with the person ,or to live there for a long time even if you had at first planned only to stay for a couple of days there, so is the school .If the new students are impressed by the attractiveness of scenery ,the kindness of the volunteers ,the timely services and all the other things they have experienced at the first day ,it will inevitably attract them to live and study at the school. 
	Of course, dozens of services the school can offer besides the above said, but the aim of the service is the same, that is, to help the new students to get used to the new environment more quickly and make them love to study and live at the school and be free of nostalgia for some mummy boys.

Topic 173.	Borrowing money from a friend @It is sometimes said that borrowing money from a friend can harm or damage the friendship. Do you agree? Why or why not? Use reasons and specific examples to explain your answer.
Essay 1: I don't think it's a very good idea to borrow money from a friend. It can cause resentment and awkwardness in the relationship. How do you approach your friend without making him feel he has to do this for you? It's unlikely he'll feel as if he can turn you down. Can he turn you down without insulting you? Probably not. 
	How do you know whether your friend can afford to lend you the money? He may be embarrassed to admit he's a little short of funds himself. Or he might not want to disappoint you. So he lends you the money and then he needs money, too. 
	There's also the question of when you'll pay back the loan. It's awkward for your friend to ask for a deadline for repayment. Besides, if you're short of funds, you may not be able to predict when you'll pay him back. What about interest on the loan? If it's a small amount of money, this doesn't matter. However, if large funds are involved, and you won't be paying it back for a while, should you offer to pay interest? Should your friend ask you to pay interest? All these issues can result in hurt feelings and can harm the friendship. 
	It's possible, of course, that if you borrow money from a friend and pay it back in a timely fashion, this will create a special bond between the two of you. You'll know that you can count on your friend when you need help. He'll know you're trustworthy. 
	However, more often than not, money issues between friends are an embarrassment. If you need money, it's better to go to a bank for a loan.
@Notes: 
Topic 174.	Your generation and your parents' @Every generation of people is different in important ways. How is your generation different from your parents' generation? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.
Essay 1: The principal differences between my generation and my parents' generation are in how they relate to others. My generation is more tolerant of other people's choices, less concerned about what others think, and more self-centered. 
	My parents' generation has stricter standards about what kinds of behavior are acceptable. They sometimes have a hard time accepting the fact that other people may have different ideas about what's right and what's wrong. My generation thinks people should have a lot of choices. For example, they choose whom they want to live with, whether or not to have children, whether or not to practice a particular religion, and what to do for a living. 
	My parents (generation is much more concerned about what other people think of them. Many grew up in tightly knit communities where people knew each other's families. Fitting in meant that you had to act a certain way. Many of my generation grew up in loosely knit communities, where we only knew about our closest neighbours. We didn't care what the rest of the community thought of us. Also, we were a very rebellious generation and often did things just to shock people. 
	Wherever we grew up, most of my generation didn't have to worry about having enough to eat or a roof over our heads. My parents' generation did. They grew up during the Great Depression, when many people were poor. For this reason, my parents didn't have time to analyse their feelings or think about their inner selves. They were too busy trying to get by. Children of my generation were well taken care of by their parents. Because of that, we had time to think about ourselves and our place in the universe. As adults, many of us have continued to be self-absorbed. We join health clubs to be perfect in body and go into therapy to be perfect in mind. 
	When I think about our actions, it seems that my parents' generation is more "outer" directed and my generation is more "inner directed."

Topic 175.	What type of class do you like? @Some students like classes where teachers lecture (do all of the talking) in class. Other students prefer classes where the students do some of the talking. Which type of class do you prefer? Give specific reasons and details to support your choice.
Essay 1: In my country, the lecture system is the most common system. It is the one I prefer for three reasons: I am used to the lecture system; it is an efficient system; I am too shy to talk in class. 
	All my life, I have listened to teachers. They come into the room, open their books, and start to lecture. We students sit quietly at our desks and take notes. We never ask questions because we don't want to seem stupid. At the end of the course, we are given a test. If we can repeat on the test what the teacher said in class, we will get a good grade. 
	The lecture system is an efficient one. The teacher is the one who knows the subject, not the students. It is a waste of time listening to a student's ideas. What good will that do me? Time is short. I want the teacher to give me as much information as he or she can during the class period. 
	Even if we could talk in class, I would never open my mouth. I am much too shy. I would be afraid the other students would laugh at me and make fun of my ideas. I prefer to listen to the teacher and memorize the teacher's ideas. 
	I hope I can always study in a school where they use the lecture system. I think it is better to continue with what one is used to. I also think that there is a lot of information that I must learn in the most efficient manner possible. I wouldn't want to interrupt a teacher with my foolish questions.
